Wade, said Friday that government institutions shouldn't be \\\"bullied\\\" into delivering what some see as the preferred outcome. \\\"The events of earlier this week is one symptom of that,\\\" Thomas said. He added that \\\"you cannot have a free society\\\" without stable institutions.His comments came before an audience of mostly judges and lawyers at the 11th Circuit Judicial Conference in Atlanta. Chief Justice John Roberts had addressed the same conference Thursday, calling the leak \\\"absolutely appalling.\\\" Thomas' comments echoed a speech from last fall when the justice decried attempts to \\\"manipulate\\\" institutions. Back then, he appeared to be nodding to progressive attempts to add more members to the Supreme Court to dilute the conservative majority. \\\"I think we should be careful destroying our institutions because they don't give us what we want when we want,\\\" he said at the time.On Friday, Thomas also reiterated that he believes Supreme Court justices are obligated to take a fresh look at established precedent and shouldn't be bound by the judicial doctrine called \\\"stare decisis.\\\" The legal principle is translated as \\\"stand by that which has been decided\\\" and is meant to reinforce stability in the law. Thomas has long been a critic of a strict reading of the doctrine.\\\"We use stare decisis as a mantra when we don't want to think,\\\" Thomas said Friday. But he noted that unlike lower courts, the Supreme Court is the \\\"end of the line.\\\" If the justices \\\"don't take a look at it, who does?\\\" he asked.He has expressed similar sentiments before, but the talk comes the same week that Politico obtained the draft opinion that sets out to overturn a nearly 50-year-old precedent.Although not final, the February draft reflects that a majority of the court -- presumably including Thomas -- cast initial votes to overturn the landmark opinion that legalized abortion nationwide. Thomas has been clear that he thinks the 1973 opinion was wrongly decided. In June 2020, for example, he called the ruling \\\"grievously wrong.\\\" Although the leak -- an unprecedented breach of court protocol -- stunned members of the court, Thomas appeared relaxed and upbeat Friday when he was greeted by a standing ovation. The moderator commenced the talk by asking Thomas about his health. \\\"Well, I'm vertical,\\\" Thomas said and then burst into a booming laugh.He touched on a wide variety of subjects, including his \\\"bias\\\" of hiring clerks from what he called \\\"modest circumstances.\\\" He noted that most of the other justices hire clerks from the Ivy League, but he said that those who don't come from elite law schools bring \\\"wisdom\\\" and \\\"common sense, hard work and decency.\\\" He also said opinion writing should be straightforward with an aim of \\\"getting it right.\\\"\\\"There is no need to make the work product inaccessible,\\\" he said.He also called the pending retirement of Justice Stephen Breyer \\\"brutal.\\\" \\\"It is really hard to see him leave,\\\" Thomas said.\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":61,\"topic\":\"politics\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Ariane De Vogue,Cnn Supreme Court Reporter\",\"media\":\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220324144311-02-clarence-thomas-1021-super-tease.jpg\",\"is_opinion\":true,\"twitter_account\":null,\"_score\":1.998283,\"_id\":\"e3799df3dfb7dc5d60cc4a4c1120952d\"},{\"title\":\"Judge dismisses Trump lawsuit against Twitter over ban\",\"author\":\"Brian Fung, CNN\",\"published_date\":\"2022-05-06 22:16:54\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/06/tech/trump-twitter-lawsuit-dismissed/index.html\",\"clean_url\":\"cnn.com\",\"excerpt\":\"A federal judge in San Francisco has dismissed former President Donald Trump's lawsuit against Twitter that sought to reinstate his banned account on the platform, according to a court filing.\",\"summary\":\"(CNN Business)A federal judge in San Francisco has dismissed former President Donald Trump's lawsuit against Twitter that sought to reinstate his banned account on the platform, according to a court filing. The decision is a victory for Twitter, which had asked Judge James Donato, of the US District Court for the Northern District of California, to toss out the suit. In throwing out Trump's case, Donato held that Twitter was not acting as an agent of the US government \\u2014 as Trump had alleged \\u2014 when it shut down his account and was therefore not infringing on Trump's First Amendment rights to free speech.\\\"The amended complaint does not plausibly allege a First Amendment claim against Twitter,\\\" the decision said. \\\"Plaintiffs' first claim is dismissed.\\\" \\\"Donato also threw out Trump's other claims, such as that Section 230 \\u2014 the law shielding tech platforms from lawsuits over most user-generated content \\u2014 is unconstitutional.Twitter declined to comment on the suit's dismissal. Trump could continue to pursue the case, with Donato ruling that he can file an amended complaint, though the ruling also states that Trump will not be permitted to add any new legal claims.Since Trump's filing of the suit, billionaire Elon Musk has sought to buy Twitter for $44 billion. Musk has said he wants to restore \\\"free speech\\\" to the platform and conservatives believe Trump could be reinstated under Musk's ownership of the platform. Trump has said he will not return to Twitter even if his account is restored, highlighting his new social media venture, Truth Social.\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":61,\"topic\":\"politics\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Brian Fung\",\"media\":\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220506175103-donald-trump-file-050122-super-tease.jpg\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":null,\"_score\":1.998283,\"_id\":\"73cd81bde4a674c8cd4f899b3d1bd7d7\"},{\"title\":\"Norman Mineta, transportation secretary during 9/11, dies\",\"author\":\"Gregory Wallace, CNN\",\"published_date\":\"2022-05-03 20:55:51\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/politics/norman-mineta-transportation-secretary-congress/index.html\",\"clean_url\":\"cnn.com\",\"excerpt\":\"Norman Mineta, who oversaw the Department of Transportation during the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, died on Tuesday afternoon.

Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger \\u2013 continues its investigation into everything leading up to, and involving, the January 6 attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters that interrupted the certification of Joe Biden's election win.\\n\\nOf special interest, according to CNN reporting, are Trump's activities on January 6 and the efforts to use the levers of government to overturn the election.\\n\\nThe committee has issued at least 80 subpoenas requesting testimony or phone records from close Trump advisers, including Rudy Giuliani and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, 'Stop the Steal' rally organizers and former White House staffers. It's also asked some GOP lawmakers to cooperate as well.\\n\\nThe panel has obtained over 2,000 of Meadows' text messages, including exchanges with GOP lawmakers, the Trump family, Fox host Sean Hannity, and conservative activist Ginni Thomas, among others.\\n\\nMultiple sources previously told CNN that the committee is planning to produce a multimedia presentation and hire a writer as part of its effort to turn its largely secretive work into a compelling narrative.\\n\\nJanuary 6: Lawsuits by Democratic lawmakers and police officers\\n\\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers and members of the US Capitol Police and Washington, DC Metropolitan Police are suing Trump, saying his words and actions incited the riot. Various cases accuse Trump of directing assault and battery; aiding and abetting assault and battery; and violating local Washington, DC, laws that prohibit incitement of riots and disorderly conduct.\\n\\nA federal judge in February said Trump's statements to his supporters before the riot 'is the essence of civil conspiracy,' Judge Amit Mehta wrote in a 112-page opinion, because Trump spoke about himself and rallygoers working 'towards a common goal' of fighting and walking down Pennsylvania Avenue.\\n\\n'The President's January 6 Rally Speech can reasonably be viewed as a call for collective action,' Mehta said, allowing the civil cases to go forward.\\n\\nMehta, however, has dismissed the challenges against Giuliani, Donald Trump Jr. and GOP Rep. Mo Brooks.\\n\\nTrump and his top advisers have not been charged with any crimes. Trump and others who are sued have argued they are not responsible for the actions of the people who stormed the Capitol.\\n\\nWhite House documents: Moved to Mar-a-Lago? Classified? Flushed?\\n\\nThe National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, says at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort \\u2013 including records that may have been classified.\\n\\nIt's been widely reported that Trump would also rip up documents in the White House, but The New York Times' Maggie Haberman has reported that that some may have been flushed down toilets. (Trump has denied this.)\\n\\nAny unauthorized retention or destruction of White House documents raises a red flag under a criminal law that prohibits the removal or destruction of official government records, legal experts tell CNN.\\n\\nThe FBI and federal prosecutors are investigating.\\n\\n2020 Election: Efforts to overturn Georgia results\\n\\nFulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis launched a special grand jury on Monday investigating what Trump or his allies may have done in their efforts to overturn Biden's victory in Georgia.\\n\\nThe probe was launched last year following Trump's call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which he pushed the Republican to 'find' votes to overturn the election results.\\n\\n'This is a criminal investigation. We're not here playing a game,' Willis told CNN's Sara Murray. 'I plan to use the power of the law. We are all citizens.'\\n\\nAs part of the investigation, Willis has been digging into Trump's calls with Raffensperger and another official in the Secretary of State's office; presentations Giuliani made before state lawmakers that were riddled with election falsehoods; a phone call between South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Raffensperger; and the sudden departure of Byung 'BJay' Pak, the US attorney for the Northern District of Georgia.\\n\\nWillis has been the target of racist threats and has asked the FBI for security assistance.\\n\\n2020 Election: Fake electors in Michigan\\n\\nThe Justice Department is looking at one aspect of a plot to put forward fake electors from seven states after a referral from the Michigan state attorney general.\\n\\nFake certificates were created by Trump allies in Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada and New Mexico, who sought to replace valid presidential electors from their states with a pro-Trump slate.\\n\\nMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said forgeries of public records and election records could bring nearly 20 years in jail, according to state law. While nobody has been charged with a crime, Nessel said she has referred her investigation into the effort in Michigan to the US Justice Department.\\n\\nOne fake elector from Michigan boasted at a recent event hosted by a local Republican organization that the Trump campaign directed the entire operation.\\n\\n'We fought to seat the electors. The Trump campaign asked us to do that,' Meshawn Maddock, co-chair of the Michigan Republican Party, said at a public event last week that was organized by the conservative group Stand Up Michigan, according to a recording obtained by CNN.\\n\\nTrump Organization: NY AG criminal and civil investigation\\n\\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James is investigating Trump's namesake business, and recently detailed what her office believes are 'misleading or fraudulent' financial statements.\\n\\nJames says her office has uncovered 'significant' evidence 'indicating that the Trump Organization used fraudulent or misleading asset valuations to obtain a host of economic benefits, including loans, insurance coverage and tax deductions.'\\n\\nShe recently broadened her civil investigation to include the role of the company's long-time appraiser Cushman & Wakefield.\\n\\nIn April, a state judge moved to hold Trump in civil contempt in a fight over James' subpoena for documents.\\n\\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and has repeatedly said James' investigation is politically motivated.\\n\\nTrump Organization: NY DA criminal investigation\\n\\nManhattan DA Alvin Bragg inherited that office's probe into Trump's businesses, but charges seem more unlikely as the grand jury has expired.\\n\\nProsecutors were focusing on the accuracy of the Trump Organization's financial statements when seeking financing, people familiar with the matter have told CNN.\\n\\nBut in February, Carey Dunne and Mark Pomerantz, two senior prosecutors on the team, resigned last month \\u2013 one day after Bragg informed them that he wasn't prepared to move forward with criminal charges, CNN's Kara Scannell reported.\\n\\nTrump and his niece Mary are in court over her cut of a 2001 family settlement.\\n\\nPersonal finances: Litigation with niece Mary Trump\\n\\nIn 2020, Mary Trump sued Trump, his sister Maryanne Trump Barry, a retired judge, and the executor of her late uncle Robert Trump's estate, alleging 'they designed and carried out a complex scheme to siphon funds away from her interests, conceal their grift, and deceive her about the true value of what she had inherited.'\\n\\nMeanwhile, the former President is suing his niece and The New York Times in New York state court over the disclosure of his tax information.\\n\\nDefamation: Suit over denial of rape claims by E. Jean Carroll\\n\\nMagazine writer E. Jean Carroll alleged Trump raped her in a New York department store dressing room in the mid 1990s and defamed her when he denied the rape, said she was not his type and alleged she made the claim to boost sales of her book.\\n\\nTrump and the Justice Department say Trump was a federal employee and his statements denying Carroll's allegations were made in response to reporters' questions while he was at the White House. They argue the Justice Department should be substituted as the defendant, which, because the government cannot be sued for defamation, would end the lawsuit.\\n\\nA federal judge denied that effort. DOJ and Trump appealed the ruling, and no decision has been made.\\n\\nTrump lost an attempt to countersue earlier this year. A judge called Trump's motion 'futile.' He agreed with Carroll's argument that Trump's effort was 'at least in part for a dilatory purpose and thus at least in part in bad faith.'\\n\\nMichael Cohen: Claims of retaliation against Trump and Barr\\n\\nTrumps' former lawyer, Michael Cohen, is suing Trump, former Attorney General William Barr and others, alleging they put him back in jail to prevent him from promoting his upcoming book while under home confinement.\\n\\nCohen was serving the remainder of his sentence for lying to Congress and campaign violations at home, due to Covid-19 concerns, when he started a social media campaign in summer 2020, Courthouse News reported.\\n\\nIn retaliation, Cohen says he was sent back to prison and spent 16 days in solitary until a federal judge intervened.\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":61,\"topic\":\"politics\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Dan Berman\",\"media\":\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220501211142-donald-trump-0501.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":null,\"_score\":1.998283,\"_id\":\"18e9590b676664a4cc1dccd17c7e9f02\"},{\"title\":\"Watch: CNN anchors read list of 201 mass shootings that have happened in the United States in 2022\",\"author\":null,\"published_date\":\"2022-05-16 11:42:41\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2022/05/16/us-mass-shootings-2022-new-day-sot-vpx.cnn\",\"clean_url\":\"cnn.com\",\"excerpt\":\"So far this year, there have been 201 mass shootings in the United States, and it's only May.

Members of the media were barred from attending the event, but an event attendee offered a recording to CNN. This was not the first time either candidate barred journalists from events \\u2013 both have been consistently dodging reporters in the final days of their campaigns.\\n \\n\\n In her speech Saturday, Barnette cast her two top opponents \\u2013 celebrity surgeon Mehmet Oz and former hedge fund manager Dave McCormick \\u2013 as fake conservatives.\\n \\n\\n 'You have Mehmet Oz, who never used his public platform to push any of our America First agenda. He has never. And now we are being told he is a MAGA conservative. Never,' she said, before attacking McCormick for the ties the hedge fund he previously led has to China. 'You cannot be in bed with China financially if you are not also in bed with China ideologically. \\u2026 And yet they are telling us they are conservative. Pay attention.'\\n \\n\\n McCormick on Friday portrayed his work in China as 'negotiating against' the country, adding that 'no one has the credentials and the toughness to go toe to toe with China like I do.'\\n \\n\\n Barnette also used a portion of her speech to respond to the way her opponents and their super PACs have been portraying the surging candidate. A CNN fact check of an anti-Barnette ad by the American Leadership Action, a pro-Oz super PAC, found that it 'wildly distorts the past remarks and positions' of the candidate by tying her to the Black Lives Matter movement and beliefs about systemic racism in police departments.\\n \\n\\n 'The swamp does not only consist of Democrats. I don't know if you know that,' Barnette said in her speech, referencing the 'drain the swamp' message made popular during the 2016 campaign of former President Donald Trump, who has endorsed Oz. 'You can see it with what they are doing to me. Everything I said about myself, I have not exaggerated, I have not embellished. I have been very forthcoming. I have been running for 13 months, but these people are acting like I just crawled from under a rock yesterday.'\\n \\n\\n She added: 'Look at that video they did, right? I have never supported Black Lives Matter. I have never said our country was systemically racist. In fact, I have always said the opposite, I have always said my story shows you just how far we have come as a nation.'\\n \\n\\n Trump's endorsement of Oz has spurred a backlash from conservative activists in Pennsylvania, some of whom have gravitated towards Barnette because of the former President's decision.\\n \\n\\n Trump said in a statement Thursday that Barnette was not a viable general election candidate.\\n \\n\\n 'Kathy Barnette will never be able to win the General Election against the Radical Left Democrats,' he said.\\n \\n\\n Barnette also took issue Saturday with the focus on her past tweets. A CNN report found that her tweets and past appearances included anti-Muslim and anti-gay statements and pushing the false conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama is a Muslim. He is a Christian.\\n \\n\\n 'No one is talking about my old tweets,' she said. 'They have got to go 10 years almost into the past to find \\u2026 not a complete thought or a sentence and say this is who she is.'\\n \\n\\n Barnette also attacked Fox host Sean Hannity, who has had Oz on his show and asked him about some of her past tweets. She told the audience that Hannity is 'doing exactly what he and others have said about the left, he is sowing disinformation in order to suppress our vote, in order to steal an election. That is exactly what they are doing.'\\n \\n\\n Polls have shown Barnette surging in the Republican Senate primary. A Fox poll released this week had all three candidates \\u2013 Oz, McCormick and Barnette \\u2013 in a virtual tie, causing consternation and worry among Republicans who believe Barnette could be a wild card in November.\\n \\n\\n Barnette took issue with that assumption Saturday, arguing that the Republican Party often makes mistakes in choosing nominees.\\n \\n\\n 'I believe the Republican Party has the best story. \\u2026 We keep picking people who suck at telling our story. We do,' she said. 'We keep picking the same old, same old people, thinking we are going to get a different result.'\\n \\n\\n On the criticisms of her, she added: 'Their problem with me is that I didn't ask for permission. I didn't ask for permission. I just walked right thorough the front door.'\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":61,\"topic\":\"politics\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Dan Merica\",\"media\":\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220514211524-kathy-barnette-220511.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":null,\"_score\":1.998283,\"_id\":\"5cb93cba87b36959f132d5542122daa9\"},{\"title\":\"This state is Donald Trump's Achilles' heel\",\"author\":\"Analysis by Adam Wollner, CNN\",\"published_date\":\"2022-05-13 22:30:15\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/13/politics/trump-georgia-primary-gop-status/index.html\",\"clean_url\":\"cnn.com\",\"excerpt\":\"Georgia continues to be a vexing state for Donald Trump.\",\"summary\":\"(CNN)Georgia continues to be a vexing state for Donald Trump. First, Trump became the first Republican to lose Georgia in a presidential election in 28 years, in 2020. Then, Georgia emerged as the focal point of Trump's unfounded claims of voter fraud, as he pushed state officials to overturn the election results -- actions that are now under investigation by an Atlanta-area district attorney. And to cap it off, despite (or perhaps because of) Trump's best efforts, Republicans lost two Senate seats in Georgia in January 2021, handing Democrats control of the chamber. Now, one of the former President's top targets for defeat in 2022 -- Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, one of the officials who refused to go along with Trump's election schemes -- has a commanding lead in the polls heading into the May 24 primary. And a growing list of high-profile Republicans, including onetime Trump allies, are jumping in to help Kemp across the finish line -- and deliver a blow to the former President. Former Vice President Mike Pence announced Friday that he would rally with Kemp as the governor seeks to fend off a primary challenge from the Trump-backed former Sen. David Perdue. It marks one of the most significant splits yet for Pence from his former boss, who he also called out by name earlier this year for claiming Pence had had the ability to overturn the 2020 election as vice president. Pence is far from alone. Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts, who helped defeat a Trump-endorsed candidate in the state's GOP gubernatorial primary this week, and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, who has drawn Trump's ire for certifying Joe Biden's 2020 win in the state, are also scheduled to campaign for Kemp. Ricketts and Ducey co-chair the Republican Governors Association, which has made the unusual move of intervening in the primary to run ads on Kemp's behalf. Joining Ricketts and Ducey on the trail will be former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a former Trump adviser who has become an outspoken critic of the former President. Like Pence, Christie may be eyeing a White House run of his own in 2024. And former President George W. Bush is set to headline a fundraiser for Kemp next week.Add it all up, and it amounts to the most concerted GOP effort to hand Trump a defeat in the midterm elections to date.It's worth noting that if Kemp weren't in such a strong position -- he could even eclipse the 50% mark in the primary necessary to avoid a runoff -- these Republicans might not have felt as comfortable sticking their necks out against Trump, who remains the party's most dominant figure. Even if they represent only a minority, there is clearly still a slice of the Republican Party that doesn't want to simply go down every road Trump takes them on. And symbolically, there are few better places for those Republicans to make a stand than Georgia.The Point: A loss in Georgia wouldn't do much to threaten Trump's status as the leader of the GOP. But given his history there and the Republicans who have lined up against him, it would be an especially stinging one.\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":61,\"topic\":\"politics\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Analysis Adam Wollner\",\"media\":\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220512153510-donald-trump-0402-file-super-tease.jpg\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":null,\"_score\":1.998283,\"_id\":\"7a61dbcd708f9c89aa8dad3a707faf80\"},{\"title\":\"New satellite images reveal North Korea has restarted construction on long-dormant nuclear reactor\",\"author\":\"Zachary Cohen, CNN\",\"published_date\":\"2022-05-13 20:35:32\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/13/politics/north-korea-restarts-construction-nuclear-reactor-satellite-images/index.html\",\"clean_url\":\"cnn.com\",\"excerpt\":\"North Korea appears to have resumed construction at a long-dormant nuclear reactor in recent weeks that, if completed, would dramatically increase its capacity to produce plutonium for nuclear\\u2026\",\"summary\":\"(CNN)North Korea appears to have resumed construction at a long-dormant nuclear reactor in recent weeks that, if completed, would dramatically increase its capacity to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons, according to new satellite images obtained by CNN and a source familiar with recent US intelligence reporting on the matter.The satellite images, which were captured by Maxar during April and May of this year, show North Korea has restarted construction of the second reactor at its Yongbyon nuclear complex after years of inactivity, experts at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies who analyzed the photos said. The reactor is about 10 times larger than the existing nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, which has been operating since the late 1980s.US officials are also aware of and closely monitoring recent activity at Yongbyon, according to a source familiar with the situation, who noted North Korea is not trying to hide its efforts to restart construction on the reactor in question.This appears to be an outward demonstration of North Korea's nuclear progress and ambitions, the source said, adding that new construction on the Yongbyon reactor aligns with Pyongyang's aim of proving it's a nuclear armed state.Experts say it is difficult to estimate how quickly North Korea could complete construction of the reactor. But once operational, it could allow North Korea to increase its production of plutonium for nuclear weapons by a factor of 10, according to Jeffrey Lewis, a weapons expert and professor at the Middlebury Institute.Lt. Col. Martin Meiners, a Pentagon spokesman, declined to comment when asked if there is specific intelligence suggesting North Korea has taken new steps to complete construction of the reactor at Yongbyon.\\\"However, we've been very clear on the threat posed by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) nuclear and missile programs, our commitment to the defense of the ROK, Japan, and the U.S. homeland, and our shared objective of the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\\\" Meiners added.North Korea halted construction of the nuclear reactor at Yongbyon in 1994 under the framework of its agreement with the US. At that point the reactor was still years away from completion, Lewis said.Only very limited construction activities were observed at the site in subsequent years but Lewis told CNN that he and his fellow researches believe the recent satellite images provide \\\"the first unambiguous indicator that North Korea is moving to complete the reactor.\\\"Specifically, the images taken by Maxar show that North Korea is \\\"connecting the secondary cooling loop of the 50 MW(e) reactor to a pumphouse on the river,\\\" he said.\\\"In the image dated April 20, construction equipment is visible, as are what appear to be pipe segments. By May 7, North Korea had buried the pipe,\\\" Lewis added.\\\"The connection of the cooling loop helps explain other activities seen at the 50MW(e) reactor in recent years,\\\" Lewis told CNN, pointing to the observed demolition of a building last year that was believed to house a cooling pond for spent fuel.\\\"Connecting the secondary cooling loop suggests, in hindsight, that the demolition of the apparent spent-fuel building was an early sign that North Korea intends to complete construction of the reactor,\\\" told CNN. The source familiar with the matter also said that there is a lot of preparatory activity required before any country can start construction on a nuclear reactor. \\\"Preparatory activities speak to intent, planning and long held goals,\\\" the source added.CNN reported earlier this month that US military and intelligence agencies assess North Korea could be ready to resume underground nuclear testing in the near term.The assessment concludes that Kim Jong Un's government is making preparations at another facility, the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, and could be ready to conduct a test by the end of the May.Signs of personnel and vehicle activity at the site have been seen through satellite imagery, but the officials do not know if the regime has placed nuclear material in one of the underground tunnels at the test site, which the US has been closely watching.If North Korea conducts a test, it would be the country's seventh underground nuclear test and the first in nearly five years.CNN's Oren Liebermann and Barbara Starr contributed reporting\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":61,\"topic\":\"politics\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Zachary Cohen\",\"media\":\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220503235506-kim-jong-un-0428-super-tease.jpg\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":null,\"_score\":1.998283,\"_id\":\"a6170d94efaea41e636ca74b0606f48b\"},{\"title\":\"US mulls what Putin's end game might look like as war in Ukraine grinds on\",\"author\":\"Kaitlan Collins, CNN\",\"published_date\":\"2022-05-10 12:00:12\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/10/politics/putin-end-game-biden-administration/index.html\",\"clean_url\":\"cnn.com\",\"excerpt\":\"US officials found Russian President Vladimir Putin muted and subdued when he delivered his Victory Day address on Monday, further obscuring their attempts to ascertain the Russian leader's ultimate\\u2026\",\"summary\":\"(CNN)US officials found Russian President Vladimir Putin muted and subdued when he delivered his Victory Day address on Monday, further obscuring their attempts to ascertain the Russian leader's ultimate objectives in Ukraine.Officials inside the Biden administration have been contemplating ways Putin could exit his unprovoked war should he choose to do so, as the conflict grinds on and the Russian leader loses his chance for a quick triumph.US officials still believe Putin is undeterred and wants a tangible victory in Ukraine. But they don't know what measure could be sufficient for Putin to declare victory, one official told CNN, who said his goals are not readily apparent.The difficulty in assessing Putin's aims was underscored by comments from President Joe Biden at a fundraiser Monday night, where he said he is concerned the Russian leader has not yet devised a way out of the ongoing war in Ukraine, despite Putin's \\\"calculating\\\" nature. CIA Director Bill Burns shared similar concerns over the weekend, describing Putin \\\"in a frame of mind in which he doesn't believe he can afford to lose.\\\"\\\"I think he's convinced right now that doubling down still will enable him to make progress,\\\" Burns said. Putin so far has failed to achieve any of his major war objectives in Ukraine. After initially believing his forces could take Kyiv and dismantle President Volodymyr Zelensky's government within days, Putin was forced to recalculate and focus on eastern Ukraine. But that, too, has proven to be an incremental fight, according to assessments from the Pentagon.While officials continue to privately assess what Putin's new goal may be, Biden has ordered his top national security officials to clamp down on leaks about certain kinds of intelligence the US is providing to Ukraine. Biden was furious following a New York Times report that said US intelligence was helping kill Russian generals. Although his aides pushed back, Biden felt the matter warranted his direct involvement. He arranged calls with his top national security officials with the intent of delivering a message: the leaks needed to stop. Biden, officials told CNN, believed the reports about US intelligence playing a role in the deaths of Russian generals and the sinking of Russian ships were overstated, unhelpful and poorly disclosed, officials said. While US officials have intentionally released certain intelligence since Russia invaded Ukraine, Biden believed this was not strategic and downplayed the strength of Ukrainian intelligence, an official said. Instead, Biden believed that information was best kept secret. Administration officials have previously insisted there are clear limits on the intelligence it shares with Ukraine, including a ban on providing precision targeting intelligence for senior Russian leaders by name. Those limits are part of a White House effort to avoid crossing a line that Moscow may view as too escalatory.So far, Russia has not taken any known direct action against the United States or NATO in response to ongoing military and intelligence support.US officials have been left to speculate why Moscow has held back, particularly when it comes to cyberattacks, which the US warned ahead of the war that Russia might use as retribution for US assistance. Russia has also not moved to strike Kyiv during the visits of a host of senior American leaders, from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Secretary of State Antony Blinken. And the country has also not attempted to strike arms shipments flowing through Poland, a NATO nation. Only recently has Russia begun targeting railways inside Ukraine believed to be carrying Western arms to the fight.In addition to sharing intelligence, the US has also provided billions in aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia.Last week, Biden announced a $150 million package that includes 25,000 155mm artillery rounds, counter-artillery radars, jamming equipment and field equipment and spare parts, according to a White House official.Biden has proposed a $33 billion new aid package for Ukraine, which he sent to Congress last month. The US has made it clear it intends to provide long-term support to Ukraine, and the proposed package last week was more than twice as much as the $13.6 billion infusion of military and humanitarian aid that Congress approved last month.\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":61,\"topic\":\"politics\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Kaitlan Collins\",\"media\":\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220316153117-102-biden-putin-split-super-tease.jpg\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":null,\"_score\":1.998283,\"_id\":\"493e4fe066be0c81a01ffdbb466c0e59\"},{\"title\":\"The Supreme Court abortion leak has already transformed politics all over America\",\"author\":\"Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN\",\"published_date\":\"2022-05-10 04:20:56\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/10/politics/supreme-court-abortion-politics-mcconnell/index.html\",\"clean_url\":\"cnn.com\",\"excerpt\":\"In just a week, the leaked draft Supreme Court opinion that could overturn Roe v. Wade has transformed US politics.\",\"summary\":\"(CNN)In just a week, the leaked draft Supreme Court opinion that could overturn Roe v. Wade has transformed US politics.Every major politician with power in the country, and those striving for it, are facing sudden, profound and sometimes treacherous questions over abortion ahead of the Supreme Court's final ruling, which could differ from the draft. Some also sense huge political opportunities.Democratic governors are vowing to stand firm for abortion rights against Republican legislatures seeking to ban the procedure, even without exceptions for rape and incest in some cases. National Republican leaders are navigating a new test that could complicate what was expected to be a favorable midterm election environment for them. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, for instance, offered Democrats an opening when he let slip in an interview with USA Today that it was possible a future Republican-led Senate could vote to outlaw abortion nationwide. His GOP Senate colleagues quickly sought to downplay that remark. The current Democratic-led Senate will, meanwhile, vote Wednesday on a bill codifying abortion rights. It's expected to fail, since there may not even be enough Democrats in favor to get a simple majority, let alone reach the 60-vote threshold needed to usher most major legislation into law. But the vote will be an important symbolic moment that shapes future action on the issue. \\\"Every American is going to see where every senator stands,\\\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, on Monday.This does seem like a clarifying political moment.The left suddenly has an issue to fight on, which just might mitigate a political tempest for President Joe Biden and other Democrats in November, as they point to national polls showing a majority of Americans support keeping Roe in place. The right sees a decades-long political mission to overturn the landmark ruling at the cusp of fruition, while some conservatives are pushing to go further with total bans on the procedure.Both sides can sense a fundamental shift that could change the country socially and legally, potentially for generations, and that could sharpen the already acute cultural estrangement between red states and blue states. In places like Texas, the gulf could widen between liberal cities and conservative rural areas. Often left out of the conversation, however, are the people whom these changes would affect the most. Minority women, for example, are likely to bear the brunt of any new legal changes since they already have worse health care and outcomes.It's only been a week since the Politico story about Justice Samuel Alito's draft opinion hit the internet. But its shock waves have since slammed into pretty much every state, every lawmaker and every candidate in 2022.The reason for this is twofold. First, the legal, social, political and scientific issues surrounding abortion are emotive. But this new phase of the abortion debate is different. Before the emergence of Alito's stunning draft opinion, questions about the issue were to some extent hypothetical, since many Americans didn't see Roe as under threat. Now, depending on a final Supreme Court vote expected in the coming weeks, the federal right to an abortion could well be swept away. The ultimate political shakedown will take months to unravel. But there is a new political reality.\\\"It's raised people's awareness that this isn't just something that everybody is talking about in the abstract, but this could really happen in states across America,\\\" Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan told CNN's Jake Tapper on Monday. \\\"I do think that people suddenly are being reminded in a way that, it was not there the last few months, that their votes have consequences.\\\" State offices suddenly take on even more significance The practical impact of a Supreme Court decision to tear down Roe v. Wade would be to return the issue to state legislatures. That has imbued this fall's state elections -- for statehouses and governor -- with greater significance. Take a state like Pennsylvania, for instance, which currently has a Republican-controlled state House and Senate and a term-limited Democratic governor, Tom Wolf. If the GOP wins full control in Harrisburg, it could seek to ban access to abortions in the Keystone State. Most Republican gubernatorial candidates have staked out strong anti-abortion stances. In a gubernatorial debate, state Sen. Doug Mastriano seemed to liken the fight to abolish abortion to the movement to abolish the slave trade in the late 18th and early 19th centuries by invoking William Wilberforce, a British politician who led that movement. State Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a Democrat running for governor, has warned that unless he wins the race, abortion will be illegal in Pennsylvania.\\\"The next governor will have a bill on his desk that bans abortion. Let me tell you something: Every one of those guys will sign the bill,\\\" Shapiro said, referring to Republicans, in Wilkes-Barre on Saturday, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.Voters in other states are facing similar choices. In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who has vetoed several bills aimed at curtailing legal abortion, is running for reelection in a swing state where Republicans control both chambers of the legislature. The issue could also play in the US Senate race, where Republican Sen. Ron Johnson has high unfavorable ratings. Wisconsin Democrats will be keen to drive out younger voters and women who might be motivated by the abortion issue. In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who's also running for reelection, is fighting in court to block implementation of a 1931 state law that could come back into force if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade and could make Michigan one of the most restrictive anti-abortion states. These are all examples of campaigns in which Democrats hope that invigorated turnout from voters who care about abortion rights could push them over the line, despite voter preoccupations with soaring gas prices and high inflation in the national context. But these states also offer a glimpse of the opening for Republicans to exert extraordinary change across the country if the high court empowers states to set their own abortion laws. McConnell fumblesThe Republican Senate leader, along with ex-President Donald Trump, is most responsible for building a Supreme Court majority that could overturn Roe v. Wade. Without the Kentuckian's blockade of then-President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee before the 2016 election and the swift confirmation of Trump's pick days before the 2020 election, it's unlikely a potential anti-abortion majority would exist on the high court. McConnell made strenuous efforts last week to avoid being drawn into the political uproar, seeking to focus instead on the unprecedented leak from the Supreme Court. His strategy was of a leader keen to see where the fallout settled. But in his interview with USA Today, McConnell said \\\"it's possible\\\" that the issue could be resolved in the legislative process in the future. He did caveat that by saying that if he were majority leader, he would not sweep away the filibuster requirement, which would probably be necessary to pass a ban on abortion. And as long as Biden is President, such a Senate bill would face a certain veto. Still, McConnell's comment, which was remarkably blunt from such a taciturn public speaker, may also have given Democrats an opening to galvanize their voters by arguing a Republican-led Senate would outlaw abortion. A new digital ad by Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, for example, which accuses McConnell of mounting a \\\"decades-long crusade to criminalize abortion,\\\" underscores that point.Which is why Senate Republicans quickly mobilized to shut down the idea, CNN's Manu Raju, Melanie Zanona and Ted Barrett reported Monday evening.\\\"I don't think it's really an appropriate topic for Congress to be passing a national law on,\\\" said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a member of McConnell's leadership team. Even Missouri conservative Josh Hawley sought to distance himself from the idea. \\\"That wouldn't be my priority out of the gate,\\\" the Republican senator said. \\\"I think it would be better for states to debate this, allow it to breathe and for Congress to act where there's national consensus.\\\"Asked on Monday if he would put an abortion ban on the Senate floor under a possible GOP majority next Congress, McConnell didn't directly answer, instead pointing to his floor remarks where he said he would \\\"never support smashing the legislative filibuster on this issue or any other.\\\"\\\"I addressed that earlier today,\\\" he told CNN.But McConnell's words will live in countless Democratic campaign ads, even if the most immediate legislative changes sparked by a Supreme Court vote to overturn Roe will likely be in the states. History suggests that Democrats should also take seriously McConnell's willingness to use power he accrues.Are Republicans ready for the political implications?There were also signs Sunday that while the end of Roe v. Wade would validate a decades-long conservative campaign, some Republicans are not yet ready for the political consequences.Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves, for example, struggled to answer questions from Tapper on \\\"State of the Union\\\" about whether the legal reasoning relied upon in the draft could be used for draconian measures such as bans on birth control. \\\"It's not something that we've spent a lot of time focused on,\\\" Reeves told Tapper, in an equivocal answer that is unlikely to harm him politically in his deep red state but that is sure to be used by Democrats in their broader campaign.But Republicans also see an opening to use the renewed attention on abortion -- specifically in this spring's primaries. In Georgia, where former Sen. David Perdue is running a lagging Trump-backed challenge to the sitting governor, he called for a special legislative session to enforce a ban on abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, as he tries to court base voters. It remains to be seen whether Democrats can effectively use the issue to rev up their base and peel off enough suburban moderates to keep midterm elections in Georgia as close as the state was in 2020, when Biden narrowly won it. But the Peach State's candidates, like their counterparts nationwide, must all wrestle with this month's sudden political twist -- however the Supreme Court finally comes down on the issue.\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":61,\"topic\":\"politics\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Analysis Stephen Collinson\",\"media\":\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220509215503-supreme-court-abortion-politics-mcconnell-super-tease.jpg\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":null,\"_score\":1.998283,\"_id\":\"982bb38460698ae4493334bb8fc1dad4\"},{\"title\":\"Analysis: Candidates in Republican primaries are trying to dodge journalists\",\"author\":\"Analysis by Brian Stelter, CNN Business\",\"published_date\":\"2022-05-10 03:30:36\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/09/media/midterm-campaigns-reliable-sources/index.html\",\"clean_url\":\"cnn.com\",\"excerpt\":\"A version of this article first appeared in the \\\"Reliable Sources\\\" newsletter.\",\"summary\":\"New York (CNN Business)A version of this article first appeared in the \\\"Reliable Sources\\\" newsletter.

Here, let Lah explain...\\\"In a sign of how siloed our information sources have become,\\\" Lah wrote, \\\"midterm campaigns, many of them Republican, are widely shutting out local papers, local TV stations and national reporters. In Pennsylvania, we spoke with leading gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano's campaign because we were planning to attend a rally in Uniontown, PA. The rally was advertised as free and open to the public, with registration. The campaign instructed us to register, saying there was no separate media registration, but upon our arrival, we were told no media would be allowed.\\\"That's why Lah and McCray booked a hotel room that overlooked the rally. The Mastriano campaign was not happy when they saw the crew perched on the balcony: \\\"The campaign sent two security guards who threatened to remove us from the room,\\\" Lah wrote. \\\"But since the hotel allowed us to stay, we were within our right to observe a large event that everyone in the hotel could see.\\\"\\\"This behavior is part and parcel to how the Mastriano campaign has excluded local reporters,\\\" she added. This recent Philadelphia Inquirer article said that the campaign printed out photos of journalists in order to prevent entry to an event.Lah reported on the rally, and Mastriano's aversion to independent media, on Monday's \\\"The Lead with Jake Tapper.\\\" Later in the hour, Tapper's guest Maria Cardona gave kudos for Lah for creativity and said \\\"the fact that Mastriano's campaign did not want press there should be a red flag and a huge alert for every Pennsylvanian.\\\"But Mastriano's media-bashing talking points at the rally received thunderous applause from his supporters. That's the heart of the matter...Last week The AP's Sudhin Thanawala wrote about a related theme of the GOP primary season: \\\"Many candidates for leading offices \\u2014 often Republicans \\u2014 are abandoning the time-honored tradition of debating their rivals before Election Day.\\\" For example, Herschel Walker, the leading GOP contender for a Senate seat in Georgia, has skipped two debates. Naturally, Walker's campaign did not grant The AP's request for an interview about it.>> \\\"Debates? Skip 'em. Sit down with reporters and be grilled on policy? Nah. See, Herschel Walker doesn't make campaign stops so much as he makes appearances, speaks to fans, and poses for photos,\\\" Amanda Carpenter wrote for The Bulwark...>> Lah adds: \\\"The problem is that midterm debate dodging and only talking to primary voters who make up the party's base hurts democracy, and possibly these very campaigns, in the long run. In the 2021 Georgia US Senate runoffs, then-Senator and candidate David Perdue only spoke with right-wing press, and eventually lost his seat. It also limits what reporters can cover \\u2014 we don't want to just cover one party, that's not helpful or healthy in our polarized politics...\\\">> Running against the media is a common practice in GOP primaries, but other practices deserve scrutiny too.

But twice in Meadows' lawsuit, the House has submitted filings to the court under seal with no public explanation. \\\"The January 6 assault on the Capitol was a public event. The House Select Committee is making an effort to establish a public reckoning of that event. This Court should likewise conduct its work on this historic matter in full public view,\\\" lawyers for the media coalition wrote in a new request to the federal court in Washington, DC, on Monday. Media outlets have previously succeeded in obtaining hours of video clips from criminal court proceedings that show, up close, the violence of Donald Trump supporters during the January 6 riot. The House, in doing its own investigation separate from the hundreds of criminal cases, has faced more than two dozen lawsuits from witnesses trying to block the January 6 panel from obtaining information or from calling them to testify. Until now, those cases have largely been argued in public. Witness cases against the House are slow-moving, and Meadows' case is a critical one. In the Meadows case so far, the House has dropped hundreds of pages of witness testimony transcripts and other evidence it's collected in an attempt to show that the panel needs to question the close Trump adviser.Lawyers for the House have told DC District Court Judge Carl Nichols, who oversees the lawsuit, they now have a \\\"laser-like focus\\\" about what they'd like to ask Meadows. \\\"The Select Committee has told the American public that transparency will be key to its work,\\\" the media coalition told the court. \\\"The Press Coalition advances precisely that same public interest in transparency and accountability.\\\"The case could come to a head in court around the same time the House select committee's public hearings begin in June.

Now, Moscow is faced with an unprecedented challenge: If the continent bars imports of millions of barrels of crude, can it find new customers?\\n \\n\\n The European Union, once hesitant, is now taking steps to halt the flow of Russian oil and refined products to most member states this year as the war in Ukraine drags on. If the bloc agrees to an embargo, it would strike at the heart of Russia's economy, which has continued to reap profits from its large energy sector.\\n \\n\\n The United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Australia have already banned imports, and Japan said it would follow suit 'in principle' after a G7 meeting over the weekend. Together with an EU embargo, that would put about half the global economy off limits to Russian oil.\\n \\n\\n Moscow wouldn't be crippled overnight. Countries like India continue to snap up hundreds of thousands of barrels of crude per day, taking advantage of hefty discounts. And the Kremlin's tax receipts have been swelled by the overall increase in global benchmark prices triggered by its invasion of Ukraine.\\n \\n\\n But over time, losing Europe \\u2014 the destination for more than half of Russia's oil exports \\u2014 would deal a blow to the Kremlin, reducing government revenue as other harsh sanctions take a growing toll. It will struggle to find enough new customers to fill the gap. The International Energy Agency and other analysts predict Russian oil production will fall sharply as a result.\\n \\n\\n 'It hurts Russia, without a doubt,' said Henning Gloystein, director of the energy program at Eurasia Group, a consultancy.\\n \\n\\n Moscow relies heavily on revenues from its powerful oil and gas sector, which in January accounted for 45% of the federal government's budget.\\n \\n\\n And Europe has long been a top customer. Last year, it received about a third of its oil imports from Russia, according to the IEA. Before the invasion of Ukraine, Europe was importing about 3.4 million barrels of oil per day from Russia. \\n \\n\\n That number has fallen back slightly. Since late February, oil traders in Europe have largely shunned the Russian crude that's shipped by sea, faced with rocketing shipping costs and difficulty securing necessary financing and insurance. Europe imported roughly 3 million barrels of oil per day from Russia in April, according to Rystad Energy.\\n \\n\\n But after more than two months of war, the European Union wants to go even further. Its leaders have proposed a ban on all crude imports from Russia within six months, and an end to imports of refined products by the end of the year. \\n \\n\\n Negotiations are ongoing. While countries like Germany have been racing to curtail their reliance on Russian energy, others have said they wouldn't be ready. Hungary's government said it would need three to five years to wean itself off Russian oil. Other landlocked states such as Slovakia and the Czech Republic, which lean heavily on supplies delivered by pipelines, want similar carve-outs.\\n \\n\\n Still, the EU plan would pile pressure on Russia's economy, which the International Monetary Fund had already predicted would shrink by 8.5% this year, entering a deep recession. \\n \\n\\n Analysts at Rystad Energy and Kpler, another research firm, expect that Russia will need to curtail production by about 2 million barrels a day \\u2014 or roughly 20% \\u2014 as a result of the embargo.\\n \\n\\n 'Oil is a major source of hard currency for Russia, and since the introduction of financial sanctions has become a vital lifeline for the Russian economy and a crucial funding source for the war,' wrote experts at Bruegel, a Brussels-based think tank.\\n \\n\\n The embargo from a huge importer like Europe will have downsides. If crude prices rise as a result, Moscow could actually bring in more government revenue from oil taxes, at least in the short-term.\\n \\n\\n That hinges, however, on Russia's ability to redirect oil to other buyers. That won't be easy. \\n \\n\\n A significant portion of Russia's oil exports to Europe travel to the bloc via pipelines. Rerouting those barrels to markets in Asia would require costly new infrastructure that would take years to build.\\n \\n\\n Oil that travels by sea, meanwhile, could find alternative buyers. India \\u2014 which consumes about 5 million barrels of oil per day \\u2014 has sharply increased its imports from Russia since the war broke out.\\n \\n\\n Russia's main Urals crude is priced in relation to benchmark Brent. Before the invasion, it was trading at a discount of a few cents. Now the discount is $35 a barrel, making it much more attractive to buyers who aren't constrained by sanctions. \\n \\n\\n Data from Rystad Energy shows that India's crude imports from Russia jumped to almost 360,000 barrels per day in April, a fivefold increase over January.\\n \\n\\n 'At a time when others are willing to shirk or shun Russian crude, they are seemingly the biggest beneficiaries of lower prices here,' said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst at Kpler.\\n \\n\\n India, for its part, has played down the import spike. In a statement last week, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas said the country imports oil from all over the world, including a significant volume from the United States.\\n \\n\\n 'Despite attempts to portray it otherwise, energy purchases from Russia remain minuscule in comparison to India's total consumption,' the ministry said in a statement.\\n \\n\\n China, historically the single biggest buyer of Russian oil, had been expected to go on a shopping spree, too.\\n \\n\\n Data from Rystad, Kpler and OilX shows that imports have risen since the invasion of Ukraine, but not as dramatically. \\n \\n\\n OilX, which uses industry and satellite data to track oil production and flows, found that China's imports from Russia by pipeline and sea rose by just 175,000 barrels per day in April \\u2014 an increase of about 11% over average volumes in 2021. Seaborne imports are rising more sharply in May, according to early data. \\n \\n\\n Still, China's demand for energy has dropped as it ramps up efforts to stop the spread of the coronavirus by imposing tough restrictions on major cities. \\n \\n\\n For now, that leaves Moscow \\u2014 a close ally of Beijing's \\u2014 in the lurch.\\n \\n\\n 'The Chinese haven't piled in and gobbled it all up,' Gloystein of Eurasia Group said.\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":61,\"topic\":\"politics\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Analysis Julia Horowitz,Cnn Business\",\"media\":\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220509100147-01-russia-oil-europe-embargo.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":null,\"_score\":1.998283,\"_id\":\"847f8f85662b6885eaa03f92c0a0e407\"},{\"title\":\"White House warns against 'violence, threats, or vandalism' after protests outside Supreme Court justices homes\",\"author\":\"Betsy Klein, CNN\",\"published_date\":\"2022-05-09 14:21:20\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/09/politics/abortion-protests-supreme-court-justices/index.html\",\"clean_url\":\"cnn.com\",\"excerpt\":\"The White House on Monday condemned \\\"violence, threats, or vandalism\\\" after protesters held demonstrations outside the homes of conservative Supreme Court Justices over the weekend.\",\"summary\":\"(CNN)The White House on Monday condemned \\\"violence, threats, or vandalism\\\" after protesters held demonstrations outside the homes of conservative Supreme Court Justices over the weekend.White House press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated the Biden administration's support for the right to protest but said the justices should not feel that their safety is in jeopardy.\\\".@POTUS strongly believes in the Constitutional right to protest.

Last week, Politico published a leaked draft opinion authored by conservative Justice Samuel Alito showing the court was poised to overturn Roe v. Wade in a case concerning a Mississippi abortion law. The opinion would be the most consequential abortion decision in decades and transform the landscape of women's reproductive health in America. Protesters on both sides of the issue assembled almost immediately, fanning out across the country from the steps of the Supreme Court to Georgia to California. And over the weekend, pro-abortion rights protesters gathered outside the private homes of Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Chief Justice John Roberts in Chevy Chase, Maryland, outside Washington, DC. \\\"Keep abortion safe and legal,\\\" a few dozen protesters chanted on the street of the tony, tree-lined streets outside the justices' homes. Many held handmade signs. \\\"Keep your rosaries off our ovaries,\\\" they said. The protests were organized, in part, by Kavanaugh neighbor Lacie Wooten-Holway, who told The Washington Post, \\\"I organize peaceful candlelit vigils in front of his house. ... We're about to get doomsday, so I'm not going to be civil to that man at all.\\\" While protests around the country have largely peaceful, law enforcement officials in the nation's capital have been bracing for potential security risks. Last week, an 8-foot-tall, non-scalable fence was installed around parts of the Supreme Court building, and crews set up concrete Jersey barriers blocking the street in front of the court -- a sign that officials are worried that protests, which have so far been peaceful, could turn less so. Law enforcement officials from the National Fusion Center Association hosted a call Wednesday last with roughly 150 participants to alert state and local partners about demonstrations nationwide that have resulted in some physical confrontations, other possible demonstrations and the uptick of social media chatter, according to sources familiar with the call.The office of a conservative political organization that lobbies against abortion rights was vandalized and damaged by fire on Sunday morning in Madison, Wisconsin, in what police are investigating as arson. Following the court's confirmation that the leaked draft opinion was authentic, President Joe Biden condemned it. Psaki also reiterated the White House's calls for Congress to act to codify the women's reproductive health protections established in Roe v. Wade.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he will bring a bill codifying Roe to the floor for a vote on Wednesday. The Senate already voted once on the Women's Health Protection Act in March, but it is expected to fail in the Senate again amid widespread Republican opposition to the measure.

Officials say this estimate is based on an underlying assumption of no additional resources or extra mitigation measures being taken, including new Covid-19 funding from Congress, or dramatic new variants.\\n\\n\\n Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House Covid-19 response coordinator, confirmed the warning during an interview on ABC News Sunday, but stressed that 'whether that happens or not is largely up to us as a country.'\\n \\n\\n 'We're looking at a range of models, both internal and external models, and what they're predicting is that if we don't get ahead of this thing, we're going to have a lot of waning immunity, this virus continues to evolve, and we may see a pretty sizable wave of infections, hospitalizations and deaths this fall and winter,' Jha said. \\n \\n\\n Already, cases of Covid-19 are rising again. Infections have increased by more than 50% compared with the previous week in at least eight states. Parts of New York have moved into the 'high' designation of Covid-19 community level, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention metrics.\\n \\n\\n But could the virus really infect 100 million Americans this fall and winter? We asked Dr. Syra Madad, an epidemiologist at NYC Health + Hospitals, about the White House's warning and what it might mean for you. Our conversation, conducted over the phone and lightly edited for flow and brevity, is below. \\n \\n\\nWHAT MATTERS: What do you make of this warning from the White House?\\n\\n\\nMADAD: I think it's an extremely important warning that everybody in the United States, whether you're unvaccinated or vaccinated and boosted, should certainly take heed of because we've been in this rodeo before and we know what to do. \\n \\n\\n We have the tools and resources to protect ourselves and protect those around us. It's important that people are aware that the risk level around them is increasing. And so there are things that you can do to reduce your risk of getting infected, and certainly having a severe outcome.\\n \\n\\n When we talk about severe outcome, we know that the Covid-19 vaccines are working and holding up really well against the most severe outcomes, which is hospitalization, ICU-level care and death. At the same time, we want to make sure that there's also funding in place where pharmaceutical companies can invest in bivalent, multivalent Covid-19 vaccines. \\n \\n\\nWHAT MATTERS: Officials say the White House estimate is based on an underlying assumption of no additional resources or extra mitigation measures being taken. It sounds like you agree that additional resources would make a big difference?\\n\\n\\nMADAD: Oh, absolutely. I think the best part about these predictions is that they are predictions at the end of the day. There are models that are projecting what's going to happen in the future, and we know that we have the resources and tools to change that future.\\n \\n\\n We can prevent \\u2013 I would say by and large \\u2013 that number, that amount of people getting infected. And I think that there's a couple of questions and probably points of clarification that I'll make on that 100 million number itself.\\n \\n\\n It's unclear where they got that particular ballpark number of infections from \\u2013 one can only predict it's probably a combination of waning immunity in addition to obviously the Americans that haven't even gotten fully vaccinated. We still have millions of Americans that have only had one dose. We have millions of Americans that haven't even gotten one dose. And so it's a combination of all of those factors, along with those that are immunocompromised.\\n \\n\\n What's important is that there's transparency where this number is coming from. I just laid out some of the factors that are probably going into this number, but it's important that we do understand what are the factors that are coming into play in this model.\\n \\n\\nWHAT MATTERS: Most of the US is fully vaccinated, and a lot of people are exhausted from the last two years. How do you get people to pay attention to warnings at this point in the pandemic? \\n\\n\\nMADAD: It's a great question, and we know pandemic fatigue is real and it has already set in here in the United States. We certainly are out of the acute phase of the pandemic, meaning that it's not red sirens, even though we know obviously hundreds of Americans are still, unfortunately, dying every day, and thousands of Americans are still getting infected every day. And we know that's certainly an underestimate.\\n \\n\\n But because this virus and this disease is much more manageable because of the tools that we have, people are much more complacent. And I understand that; we are going onto year three. People want to go back to enjoying the life that they knew before this pandemic.\\n \\n\\n At the same time, I think it's just important that people realize we are still in a pandemic. As much as we don't want to be in one, that is the reality. And it's not just shaped by what's happening here in the United States. It's also shaped by what is happening around the world. And we're seeing more and more of these subvariants pop up both here in the US as well as around the world. It's just important that people realize that it's not over until it's over all around the world.\\n \\n\\n We need to just continue to be cautious. I think that we can do all the things that we love doing, but doing so in a safer manner, knowing that there's much more virus in the community.\\n \\n\\n I think really understanding it from the standpoint of: You shouldn't want to get infected. You shouldn't want to get sick, even if it's something that's manageable. For me, I think it's also the risk of long Covid. I'm not necessarily afraid of getting infected with the virus, even though I am still avoiding it. I am still masking in large indoor gatherings because I just don't want to get sick. I am actually afraid of long Covid. I don't know what the repercussions will look like in the long term. \\n \\n\\nWHAT MATTERS: What are the best metrics for people to pay attention to?\\n\\n\\nMADAD: So I would look at wastewater surveillance, which is an early indicator of telling you there's something brewing in the community and cases are rising.\\n \\n\\n I would also continue to look at the CDC's transmission level map. That kind of gives a good indication of where transmission levels are in your given community. And we know many places in the US are getting into that medium level of Covid-19 transmission, certainly here in New York City. \\n \\n\\n I still would want to know: Are hospitalization rates going up in my given community? Would there be a hospital available to me in the off chance I do get infected and I require hospitalization? But that's more of a lagging indicator.\\n \\n\\nWHAT MATTERS: Anything else you'd like to add?\\n\\n\\nMADAD: The White House is in a very tough position. They are fighting for more funding. They're making it very transparent that they are very concerned. They want to make sure that people understand that this is no joke.\\n \\n\\n That 100 million number is a very large number, and so it's really important that Congress understands that we are still in the pandemic, even though a lot of folks have put the pandemic behind them. You know, we could go back very, very quickly to the state that we were in just a few months ago with Omicron, with significant numbers of Americans getting infected. \\n \\n\\n We don't want to go back to that state, right? So we need to make sure Congress understands that this is really important for them to continue funding.\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":61,\"topic\":\"politics\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Analysis Paul Leblanc\",\"media\":\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220508195011-white-house-covid-19-projection-100-million.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":null,\"_score\":1.998283,\"_id\":\"0353d98c452259a156dac35f64155598\"},{\"title\":\"Mississippi governor says his state isn't focused on banning certain birth control 'at this time'\",\"author\":\"Paul LeBlanc, CNN\",\"published_date\":\"2022-05-09 03:39:32\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/08/politics/mississippi-abortion-contraception-roe-wade-cnntv/index.html\",\"clean_url\":\"cnn.com\",\"excerpt\":\"Mississippi Republican Gov.

Tate Reeves on Sunday hedged when asked if his state would consider banning certain forms of birth control if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, only offering that it's \\\"not what we are focused on at this time.\\\"\\\"And while I'm sure there will be conversations around America regarding [birth control] it's not something that we've spent a lot of time focused on,\\\" Reeves told CNN's Jake Tapper on \\\"State of the Union\\\" when asked if his state would consider targeting intrauterine devices and Plan B -- amid some Republican calls to ban forms of birth control. During an interview on NBC's \\\"Meet the Press\\\" later Sunday, Reeves said he didn't think future Mississippi legislation would \\\"apply to those that choose to use birth control.\\\"His comments come against the backdrop of rising concern among abortion rights activists after Politico last week reported on a draft Supreme Court majority opinion that would strike down Roe v. Wade. The opinion is not final, and it is possible the vote count will change before a formal opinion is later rolled out, likely by the end of June.But already, lawmakers in both red and blue states are beginning to draw new battle lines in expectation of a patchwork system where abortion rights are no longer protected nationwide.Mississippi is one of 13 states that has passed a so-called \\\"trigger\\\" law poised to go into effect almost immediately if Roe v. Wade is overturned. The state's law says that within 10 days of the state attorney general confirming Roe has been overturned, abortions are prohibited in the state. Limited exceptions are provided in cases of rape or when the procedure would preserve the mother's life.Mississippi passed a separate 15-week abortion ban in 2018, which is the source of the case currently in front of the Supreme Court. At the federal level, Senate Democrats plan to bring to the floor this week legislation to codify abortion rights. The bill, known as the Women's Health Protection Act, is not expected to pass since it would need at least 60 votes to overcome a GOP filibuster. In the evenly divided Senate, that would require 10 Republican senators to vote for the measure, even if all Democrats voted in favor.Celebrated by supporters of abortion rights and long reviled by critics, Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973 establishing a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability, which most experts say occurs now at around 23-24 weeks of pregnancy.Overturning Roe would be the culmination of a decades-long project of the conservative legal moment.\\\"Every one of us is standing up, speaking out, rallying, marching, talking to our constituents, lifting up their voices and their stories,\\\" Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York told Tapper on Sunday. \\\"This is the biggest fight of a generation.\\\"\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":61,\"topic\":\"politics\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Paul Leblanc\",\"media\":\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220508203556-mississippi-abortion-contraception-roe-wade-cnntv-super-tease.jpg\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":null,\"_score\":1.998283,\"_id\":\"23d9d7b536ce5c9074e89b44ae608099\"},{\"title\":\"Labor secretary to meet with companies to bolster job quality as a record number of Americans quit\",\"author\":\"Maegan Vazquez, CNN\",\"published_date\":\"2022-05-13 14:07:24\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/13/politics/labor-department-good-jobs-companies-meeting/index.html\",\"clean_url\":\"cnn.com\",\"excerpt\":\"Labor Secretary Marty Walsh will meet with several companies on Friday to discuss how the private sector can improve job quality, as a record number of employees in the United States are quitting\\u2026\",\"summary\":\"(CNN)Labor Secretary Marty Walsh will meet with several companies on Friday to discuss how the private sector can improve job quality, as a record number of employees in the United States are quitting their jobs largely in search for better opportunities. Walsh will meet with a handful of companies across different industries to highlight how they are creating jobs and sustaining their workforce through investment in training, higher wages, benefits and flexibility, according to the Department of Labor.Friday's panel will include representatives from the American Sustainable Business Network, global shipping company UPS and retailer Eileen Fisher, as well as the employee-owned energy company Sustainergy and BA Auto Care -- a family-owned business in the mid-Atlantic. The panel launches the private sector-focused work of the Biden administration's \\\"Good Jobs Initiative,\\\" which is led by the Labor Department. The initiative was started earlier this year to improve job quality and job access, establishing a broad framework across the federal government to inform workers of their rights -- including their right to collectively bargain, engage employers in improving jobs to retain workers and deploy federal agencies to support the plan.\\\"The Good Jobs Initiative is one way the Department of Labor can help improve job quality across our economy. Our work speaks directly to what workers are telling us -- that improving the quality of jobs is an economic imperative,\\\" Walsh said in a statement to CNN ahead of Friday's event. \\\"By directly engaging with businesses across all industries, we're uplifting best practices to recruit and retain workers in the current labor market. Patterns of work in America are changing, and the Department of Labor is here to support workers and companies through those changes.\\\"Friday's event comes after a strong March jobs report showed people are coming off the sidelines to rejoin the labor market and workers are leaving their jobs for opportunities that better serve their needs. Data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics released last week showed that along with 11.5 million job openings in March (the highest level since the data series began in December 2000), a record 4.5 million workers also quit their jobs. The number of quits increased most significantly in the professional and business services sector, as well as construction. But in spite of the record number of job departures, hiring still outpaced quits in every sector. And experts broadly contribute employees' exits to the potential for better opportunities. \\\"These businesses are talking about how their business models center job quality and support workers and their communities and how they have succeeded because of it,\\\" a Labor official told CNN ahead of Friday's event, underscoring how the panel is convening \\\"in the moment that we're in with our labor market\\\" where employers may find they need to adopt these practices to remain competitive.The Labor Department is also planning another meeting related to the Good Jobs Initiative later this summer to bring together industry, as well state, local and nonprofit organizations to discuss how to create partnerships to support jobs, the official said. Along with the partnerships with the private sector and public education efforts to inform workers of their rights, the official said a large portion of work of the initiative has focused on the implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure law, providing guidance to federal agencies on jobs created through new infrastructure investments. \\\"We have trillions of dollars that we invest and we need to be more strategic about how those investments support our goal of good jobs,\\\" the official said. \\\"We want family-sustaining wages. We want folks to feel empowered and respected on the job. And we want equitable access to those jobs.\\\" CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misspelled the name of retailer Eileen Fisher.\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":61,\"topic\":\"politics\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Maegan Vazquez\",\"media\":\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210928164128-sec-marty-walsh-super-tease.jpg\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":null,\"_score\":1.998283,\"_id\":\"4f4b3a40f81f5445803a512f419fab7a\"},{\"title\":\"Rand Paul blocks bipartisan effort to swiftly pass Ukraine aid\",\"author\":\"Ali Zaslav and Ted Barrett, CNN\",\"published_date\":\"2022-05-12 20:19:16\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/12/politics/rand-paul-blocks-ukraine-aid/index.html\",\"clean_url\":\"cnn.com\",\"excerpt\":\"In a rare showing of public unity, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Republican Leader Mitch McConnell took to the Senate floor to press for quick passage of a $40 billion aid bill for Ukraine\\u2026\",\"summary\":\"(CNN)In a rare showing of public unity, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Republican Leader Mitch McConnell took to the Senate floor to press for quick passage of a $40 billion aid bill for Ukraine but were blocked by GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky who is demanding changes to the legislation. Despite the high-profile pressure from the two leaders, Paul refused to blink, meaning that Schumer will need to take procedural steps to overcome his objection, which could take several days, but will ultimately lead to passage of the supplemental spending bill sometime next week.McConnell and Schumer on Thursday offered to allow a vote on Paul's amendment, but he insisted it be added to the underlying bill.The change Paul is seeking would create a special inspector general to oversee how the Ukraine military aid is spent. Members from both parties broadly agree with that notion, but forcing a change to the bill at this stage would be very time consuming and would slow getting the needed aid to Ukraine.\\\"The package is ready to go,\\\" Schumer said. \\\"The vast majority of senators on both sides of the aisle want it.

The bill was created after the assault on the home of a New Jersey federal judge, Esther Salas, whose son Daniel was shot and killed by an angry lawyer who had appeared before her in court.Paul said he did not oppose the legislation, but wanted it to be expanded to include members of Congress and therefore blocked the bill from being passed by unanimous consent. New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, who went to the floor to seek the bill's passage, said he would work with Paul to pass a separate bill dealing with concerns about the safety of lawmakers but said adding Paul's language would delay passage of the underlying bill and therefore refused to accept his changes.

Brian Kemp in Georgia ahead of the state's primary later this month, which has turned into a proxy fight between the establishment and Donald Trump wings of the GOP.The governors -- Pete Ricketts of Nebraska and Doug Ducey of Arizona -- as well as former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, will crisscross the state supporting Kemp in his primary challenge against former US Sen. David Perdue, a source familiar with the plans tells CNN.Perdue, who is endorsed by Trump, has made lies about the 2020 election results in Georgia a centerpiece of his bid to defeat the incumbent Republican governor. Trump has repeatedly criticized Kemp over his decision to certify Georgia's 2020 election results and has made the governor a top target, directing half a million dollars from his political organization to an anti-Kemp super PAC. Despite the barrage of attacks, Kemp has maintained an advantage in the polls.Ricketts and Ducey currently serve as co-chairs of the Republican Governors Association, which has poured money into the race to support Kemp, including a large TV ad buy in the state.Ricketts, Ducey and Christie al\\u200bl have clashed at times with Trump. In Nebraska, Ricketts, who is term-limited from seeking reelection, asked Trump not to wade into the Republican gubernatorial primary. Trump rejected this request, endorsing Charles Herbster, a wealthy businessman facing a slew of sexual misconduct allegations, which he has denied. Ricketts backed Jim Pillen, a member of the University of Nebraska Board of Regents, who won Tuesday's GOP gubernatorial primary in the Cornhusker State. In January, Trump said he would \\\"never\\\" endorse Ducey if he ran for US Senate in Arizona after criticizing the Republican governor for certifying the state's election in 2020. Christie has spent the last several months speaking out against Trump, for whom Christie served as an adviser and helped prepare for the 2020 election debates.

Officials say this estimate is based on an underlying assumption of no additional resources or extra mitigation measures being taken, including new Covid-19 funding from Congress, or dramatic new variants.The White House is sharing these estimates as officials renew their push to get Congress to approve additional funding to combat the virus and as the nation approaches a coronavirus death toll of 1 million. Officials have said the White House will commemorate the moment when the US surpasses 1 million deaths from Covid-19. The Biden administration has been sounding the alarm for weeks that additional funding is needed to continue the federal Covid-19 response, even as it seeks a return to \\\"normal\\\" with many pandemic-era restrictions lifting.The 100 million estimate was first reported by The Washington Post.CNN has reported that the Biden administration requested $22.5 billion in supplemental Covid-19 relief funding in March in a massive government funding package but it was stripped from the bill. That request included funding for testing, treatments, therapeutics and preventing future outbreaks. Negotiators were able to reach an agreement on a scaled-back $10 billion package, but Congress left Washington in April without passing that bipartisan bill amid a disagreement over the Title 42 immigration policy -- a pandemic-era rule that allowed migrants to be returned immediately to their home countries, citing a public health emergency.

The US Food and Drug Administration could make a decision as soon as next month based on data from manufacturers Moderna and Pfizer for distribution in the fall.\\n \\n\\n 'We're in the middle of developing new vaccines, potentially bivalent vaccines, the FDA is going to be looking at the data on this and making decisions. Our expectation is that we'll probably get a new generation of vaccines or certainly we need to plan for that,' Jha said Wednesday.\\n \\n\\n Jha continued, 'I want to make sure we have enough resources that we can buy enough vaccines for every American who wants one. I think that is absolutely critical. We do not have the resources to do that right now. So, without additional funding from Congress, we will not be able to buy enough vaccines for every American who wants one, once these new generation of vaccines come out in the fall and winter.'\\n \\n\\n The comments came as top Biden administration officials gave an update on the state of the Covid-19 pandemic, boosters, treatments, and funding during Wednesday's Covid response team briefing, the first such briefing in more than a month. Jha, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky spoke at the briefing. It was Jha's first appearance at a Covid briefing since assuming his new role last month.\\n \\n\\n It comes as cases are rising nationwide, something officials were expected to detail during the briefing. US Covid-19 deaths recently exceeded 1 million, a milestone marked by President Joe Biden last week. \\n\\n\\n The Biden administration requested $22.5 billion in additional funding for US Covid response, but that bill faces an uncertain path forward in Congress. \\n \\n\\n There have been 'preliminary conversations' with vaccine manufacturers, Jha said, but negotiations have not yet begun without the additional funding resources from Congress.\\n \\n\\n 'Every day we wait, every week we wait, we just fall a little further behind in line,' Jha said, adding that the administration is 'very committed' to finding resources from other programs to pay for at least some of these updated vaccines.\\n \\n\\n 'I think if Congress abdicate its responsibilities, it is not acceptable for us in the administration to go into the fall and winter with zero vaccines. I am confident we will find money to be able to get some Americans vaccinated, maybe just the highest risk, we don't know, but these are not decisions we want to be having to make. We want Congress to step up,' he said.\\n \\n\\n Jha also said that nearly 8.5 million US households have ordered rapid tests for Covid-19 in the first few days after the federal government made a third round of free tests available earlier this week. There are approximately 122.3 million households in the US, according to the US Census bureau.\\n \\n\\n Rapid tests, Jha told reporters, are a 'very effective way' to reduce the virus' spread. Jha characterized the demand since Monday as 'impressive,' although the 8 million households represents only a small fraction of total US households. When the White House announced the new round of tests earlier this week, it said 350 million free tests had been shipped to US households to date.\\n \\n\\n The government first launched the website to allow for the order of free tests in January. Americans were able to order their second round of tests in March. During both rounds, people could order a maximum of four tests per household. This third round doubles that.\\n \\n\\n These tests were paid for by the Covid-19 relief bill passed by Congress last year.\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":61,\"topic\":\"politics\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Betsy Klein\",\"media\":\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220512130759-ashish-jha-0426-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":null,\"_score\":1.998283,\"_id\":\"ca502adbd344fa5ecf53f6f4ac020b0b\"},{\"title\":\"The \\u2018lucky country' is facing a crucial test.

You can feel the oxygen getting taken out of the air,' recalled the 57-year-old paramedic, who was on the job treating volunteer firefighters for burns and broken bones at the time.\\n \\n\\n The second incident was this February, when relentless rain burst the banks of the Richmond River, sending a tsunami-like wave surging through the small town of Woodburn in northern New South Wales, where Morrison lives. He waded in darkness to free a boat stored in the back shed so his family could escape the floodwater.\\n \\n\\n 'I'm in total darkness. I got leeches all over me. Covered,' he told CNN, standing in boots caked with mud in his backyard after a second flood in April.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Australia has long been known as the 'lucky country,' partly due to its wealth of coal and gas, as well as minerals like iron ore, which have driven generations of economic growth.\\n \\n\\n But it's now sitting on the frontier of a climate crisis, and the fires, floods and droughts that have already scarred the country are only expected to become more extreme as the Earth warms.\\n\\n\\n Despite its exposure to the crisis, Australia has one of the worst records on climate action in the developed world, with plans under the current government to cut emissions by just 26-28% from 2005 levels by 2030 \\u2013 a target that pales in comparison to those set by its allies in the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union. Even the Business Council of Australia, which represents companies including mining interests, supports a higher target.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n On May 21, Prime Minister Scott Morrison (who is of no relation to Ken Morrison) will be asking Australians to re-elect his center-right Liberal Party and its ally, the Nationals, in a coalition government, after a three-year term bookended by climate-related disasters: The Black Summer fires in 2019-20 that razed bushland covering an area equivalent in size to the UK, claimed dozens of lives and killed or displaced roughly three billion animals. Then the floods this year that swamped Ken Morrison's home and so many others like it in New South Wales and further north in Queensland.\\n \\n\\n But the Prime Minister's bid for a second term could be thwarted by his main rival, Labor Party leader Anthony Albanese, who's promising to cut emissions by 43% by 2030. \\n \\n\\n Saturday's vote is a pivotal one \\u2013 it will either provide a mandate for more of the same, or set the country on a different path. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n According to the Ipsos Climate Change report, a survey of 1,000 voters in the last week of March showed that four in five were 'concerned' about the crisis, and two-thirds thought the country should be doing more about it.\\n \\n\\n But public surveys have been wrong before. \\n \\n\\n In 2019, opinion polls predicted a win for the opposition center-left Labor Party and its ambitious plan to boost the use of renewables and electric cars. But Labor lost, and the vote only vindicated the coalition's inaction on climate. \\n \\n\\n While current polls show Labor is on track to win this election, the crisis is now competing with other problems that appear more immediate \\u2013 the cost of living, the rise of China and inflation among them. \\n \\n\\n Ken Morrison says he's not sure who he'll vote for, but he knows it won't be either of the main parties: 'Liberal and Labor, they're the same horse with different stripes.'\\n \\n\\n Before he became prime minister, Scott Morrison cemented his position as an unflinching ally of the fossil fuel industry when he wielded a lump of coal in parliament to taunt the opposition about its renewable energy policy. \\n \\n\\n 'This is coal. Don't be afraid. It won't hurt you!' he bellowed over jeers. 'It is coal that has ensured for over 100 years that Australia has enjoyed an energy competitive advantage.'\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n That was five years ago, but the Australian government has been on the record as an international holdout on climate action since 1997, when it strong-armed delegates during the landmark Kyoto talks to secure a deal to not only avoid cutting its net emissions but to actually increase them to 108% of its 1990 levels by 2012. \\n \\n\\n Australia relies on fossil fuels to power its economy, and in the last 10 years, the mining industry has earned 2.1 trillion Australian dollars ($1.5 trillion USD) in export revenues, amounting to 21% of total GDP growth. \\n \\n\\n While much of the world is working on a green recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, Australia is considering more than 100 new fossil fuel projects, many of which could go online within the next decade.\\n \\n\\n If all fossil fuel developments under consideration in Australia went ahead, they could collectively contribute an extra 1.7 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions each year, according to research by independent think tank The Australia Institute. That is a lot of greenhouse gas \\u2013 more than three times the amount Australia already emits, and nearly double of what all the global aviation produces in a year.\\n \\n\\n The federal government has long supported coal and gas with subsidies that amounted to 10.5 billion Australian dollars (US$7.2 billion) in the 2021-22 budget, and now, its economic recovery plan is decidedly 'gas-fired.' Among its new gas projects and pipelines is the Scarborough to Pluto development in Western Australia, which will emit between 1.37-1.6 billion tons of greenhouse gasses in its lifetime, including emissions sent offshore. That's equivalent to nearly 15 new coal-fired power stations, according to recent analysis. \\n \\n\\n Australia 'appears intent on replacing fossil fuels with fossil fuels,' notes a scathing assessment from the Climate Action Tracker, which monitors climate commitments by governments. \\n\\n\\n On paper, both major parties say they want to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and are promising to spend around 20 billion Australian dollars ($14 billion) to get there.\\n \\n\\n For the coalition, that means more gas projects and investing in emissions-reducing technologies like carbon capture and storage (CCS), a method of trapping and storing carbon from fossil fuels to allow for their continued use. But the technology is not 100% effective, and scientists have warned against using it to meet climate goals.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'Climate Wars:' How Australia wasted a decade to act against climate change\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n For Labor, reaching net zero means overhauling the electricity grid, offering discounts on electric cars, and creating new solar banks and community batteries. But Albanese hasn't ruled out more coal projects, saying that applications will be approved if they 'stack up environmentally, and then commercially' \\u2013 a nod to how politically popular supporting coal mining jobs is among the party's traditional voting base. \\n \\n\\n The Greens are promising to phase out the mining, burning, and export of thermal coal by 2030 and end fossil fuel subsidies, but as a minor party its influence will be limited unless its candidates can secure enough seats to sway a hung parliament. \\n \\n\\n Back in Woodburn, northern New South Wales, some residents are still living in tents and caravans pitched in front of mud-stained houses 11 weeks after the first flood in February. Having lost everything, it would be easy to assume they'd tilt towards parties promising greater climate action. But not necessarily. \\n \\n\\n Tamara Collins, a remote nurse who lives near Ken Morrison's house, said she'll vote Labor, but only because their local candidate answered the phone when she and her husband, Tim Phillips, were scooping toxic mud from the floor of their newly renovated house.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Cam Hollows, a doctor and the son of prominent eye surgeon Fred Hollows, lives and works in the region. As water rushed into homes, he took a helicopter to remote communities cut off by floodwater to help with relief efforts. 'A lot of people that live in the bush don't choose to live here because they're lucky in life,' he said. 'The \\u2018lucky country' has a lot of unlucky people.'\\n \\n\\n About a third of the nation's 26 million people live outside major cities in regional towns and villages. The cost of living is typically lower, but life in rural Australia can be hard. There are fewer jobs and prolonged droughts have robbed many farmers of their livelihoods. \\n \\n\\n Hollows describes the 'two very different classes in Australia' in terms of caravans: 'There's the $80,000 caravans towed behind $100,000 cars and caravans that haven't had wheels for 40 or 50 years.' Some are used for extended holidays, others are permanent homes.\\n \\n\\n Woodburn is in the federal electorate of Page, a safe seat held by the National Party, the Liberal Party's conservative coalition partners, who typically represent regional voters.\\n \\n\\n In Page, Hollows expects the Liberal National Coalition to 'bleed yellow,' a reference to the United Australia Party, which is making its pitch to voters on bright yellow billboards on roads and highways around the country. The right-wing party is a collection of candidates led and bankrolled by Clive Palmer, the brusque former mining magnate who has promised to 'Make Australia Great!' on a platform of capped mortgages and pulling all Australian investments out of Europe and the US. Palmer has no climate policy at all.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Before flooding) Esri, Maxar, GeoEye, Earthstar Geographics, CNES/Airbus DS, IGN, and the GIS User Community.

There's no sense at all of the urgent need to take action,' she said. \\n \\n\\n In Dyer's view, this is a last-chance election \\u2013 one which could reveal uncomfortable truths about Australia's priorities. \\n \\n\\n 'People often say this is \\u2018not who we are as a country,'' Dyer said. 'Well, if this government is rewarded, we'd have to say, actually this is exactly who we are.'\\n \\n\\n The landmark Paris agreement in 2015 saw 200 nations put their differences aside with a promise to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century \\u2013 a commitment that was strengthened at last year's summit in Glasgow. \\n \\n\\n But neither of Australia's major parties are currently coming to the table with targets that are consistent with those goals, according to climate scientists. \\n \\n\\n The coalition's targets are currently in line with nearly 4 degrees Celsius of warming globally, while Labor's path would see a 2 degrees Celsius temperature rise, according to Climate Analytics, led by one of Australia's top scientists, Bill Hare.\\n \\n\\n Hare is acutely aware of the existential threats facing his nation, but says if enough climate-conscious candidates win their seats and apply pressure in Parliament, the election could be 'transformative.'\\n \\n\\n 'Underneath this horrible inaction lies an enormous opportunity to be a leader in clean energy,' Hare said, explaining that 'a lot of the things Australia does to enable mining and gas extraction are very relevant to the rapid scaling up of the basic supply infrastructure needed for renewables.'\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n On top of having the tools to harness more renewable energy, Australia has the natural resources to provide it, with more solar potential per square meter than any other continent, and some of the best wind assets in the world. \\n \\n\\n Renewable energy already accounts for almost 33% of the nation's power, according to the sector's peak body. And states like South Australia \\u2013 where two-thirds of electricity is generated from wind and solar \\u2013 have been world-leading in their transition away from fossil fuels. \\n \\n\\n But back in Woodburn, where the sound of yet more rain keeps locals awake at night, voters like Ken Morrison are banking on self-reliance as they stare down the barrel of more extreme weather events, rather than any kind of change in government. \\n \\n\\n The boat that he once stored in the back shed now lives in the garage beneath his two-story home, ready in the event of a flash flood. \\n \\n\\n 'And the kayak,' he said, 'so we can get in and out quickly.'\\n \\n\\n Woodburn satellite imagery provided by Geospatial Intelligence Pty Ltd and Airbus DS.

The\\u2026\",\"summary\":\"A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. (CNN)Future President Gerald Ford was the top Republican in the House when he forwarded tips about UFO sightings to the Air Force in 1966.The Air Force sent an astrophysicist, J. Allen Hynek from Northwestern University, to Michigan to investigate.\\\"Swamp gas\\\" was Hynek's \\\"flippant\\\" explanation, according to a frustrated press release Ford issued, demanding a congressional investigation into UFOs. The investigation never happened. And if you want to go down the rabbit hole of what Hynek saw and whether it was actually swamp gas, this Michigan Radio report is worth the click.Today, the military is being very careful not to appear flippant about UFOs.In fact, the number of UFO sightings logged by the US government near government property is on the rise, a US Navy Intelligence official told lawmakers on Tuesday in the first public congressional hearing on UFOs in more than 50 years.\\\"Reports of sightings are frequent and continuing,\\\" Deputy Director of Navy Intelligence Scott Bray told members of the House Intelligence Committee. Bray said the military has worked hard to remove the stigma around reporting UFOs, which they refer to as \\\"unexplained aerial phenomena,\\\" or UAPs.There's a process, introduced in 2019, for Navy pilots and other military personnel to reporting a sighting. Guidelines are posted in the cockpits of military aircraft.\\\"The message is now clear: If you see something, you need to report it,\\\" Bray said.Read CNN's full report on the hearing from congressional reporter Clare Foran.Or watch the hearing on YouTube.An official office of UAP inquiryThe Pentagon recently created a dedicated office to \\\"facilitate the identification of previously unknown or unidentified airborne objects in a methodical, logical and standardized manner,\\\" according to another official, Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security Ronald Moultrie.Critics of the office, such as Luis Elizondo, the former head of an informal UFO review within the military that helped spark new official interest, have worried that the emphasis on intelligence will cut down on transparency and accountability.Sightings are on the riseWhen the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a landmark report on UAPs in 2021, it referred to 144 reports from government sources. That figure now exceeds 400, Bray said, although many of those reports are from previous years and most lack the documentary evidence that might be needed for a more thorough investigation.Evidence is hard to come byBray showed several videos to lawmakers: one featuring a few frames of a fast-moving UAP that has not been identified, and two featuring triangle-shaped lights recorded by camera through night vision goggles. The government now thinks it's an illusion of light passing through the goggles and into the camera that created the triangular shape. The idea behind this new UFO openness is the government wants to better understand unexplained objects to make sure they don't represent some new and threatening technology.\\\"Any object that we encounter can likely be isolated, characterized, identified and, if necessary, mitigated,\\\" Moultrie said.Most objects can be explained UAPs often end up being weather balloons or new technology. But there is a bin of unexplained incidents that require more study, Bray said.Both officials said they are committed to transparency.\\\"Our goal is not to potentially cover up something,\\\" Moultrie said.But they're not exactly committed to total openness and talked about a balance between transparency and what Moultrie called \\\"preserving our warfighting advantage.\\\"Classified briefing to followThat's a gaping and subjective loophole. Conspiracy theorists will worry the lawmakers heard the really juicy stuff at a classified hearing later Tuesday.There is certainly now agreement that there's danger in the unexplained.\\\"Unidentified aerial phenomena are a potential national security threat, and they need to be treated that way,\\\" said Rep. Andr\\u00e9 Carson of Indiana, the Democratic lawmaker who convened the hearing.The top Republican at the hearing said he'd rather hear about hypersonic weapons the US knows is being developed by China and Russia, but UAPs are a worthy topic too.\\\"Inasmuch as this topic may help us better understand unknown activities of Russia and China, I am on board,\\\" said Rep. Rick Crawford of Arkansas.More disclosures across the intelligence communityMoultrie argued there's a movement toward more disclosures in the intelligence community. I think Moultrie was referring to the disclosure of intelligence about Russia's plan to invade Ukraine when he said the following:\\\"Just over the last three or four months I think that the intelligence community and the national defense apparatus have disclosed more info on various events than it has in probably the previous 10 years.\\\" A long way from Project Blue BookEven this appearance of transparency is a very different approach to UAPs than the secretive government UFO sighting program of the '40s, '50s and '60s. Specifically, Project Blue Book, run by the Air Force, is what launched a million conspiracy theories. Think Roswell, New Mexico.Project Blue Book was shuttered in the late '60s after 12,618 sightings were reported and 701 remained unexplained. Read about it at the National Archives website. The program was expensive, and none of the reported UFO sightings were shown to be a national security threat, according to the Air Force.Tic Tac video helped reignite inquiriesWhen the catalog of recent UAP sightings was released by the Director of National Intelligence in 2021, CNN's Anderson Cooper talked to retired Navy Lt. Commander Alex Dietrich. She was one of the pilots who witnessed a UAP in November 2004. It was recorded on grainy video in the famous \\\"Tic Tac\\\" video (the object was white and oval). It moved in unexpected directions at shocking speed and had no visible means of propulsion.Watch Cooper's interview with Dietrich. And read some possible terrestrial theories for what it might be in this San Diego Union-Tribune report.Dietrich described \\\"interrogation-style\\\" interviews with the Office of Naval Intelligence after that sighting. But she said it was important for people who see unexplained things to come forward, so that experts can study and explain them.\\\"I'm trying to reduce the stigma for other air crew -- so that if they see something, or when they see something, they'll say something. And that they will not feel embarrassed or ashamed to make the reports ... and that they'll contribute to this data pool of information that we have.\\\"\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":61,\"topic\":\"politics\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Zachary B.

It was a plan to create an October surprise on the eve of the election ... to use and manipulate the FBI,\\\" prosecutor Brittain Shaw said.She later said Sussmann was a \\\"high-powered DC lawyer\\\" who \\\"lied to direct the power and resources of the FBI to his own ends, and to serve the agendas of his clients,\\\" who were the Clinton campaign and a tech executive.Sussmann has been charged with one count of lying to the FBI, and the case was brought as part of Durham's investigation into potential misconduct related to the FBI's Trump-Russia probe. The indictment accuses Sussmann of falsely telling the FBI he wasn't representing any clients when he provided the Trump-Russia tip in September 2016. Sussmann has pleaded not guilty.Prosecutors appealed to the jurors to set politics aside and convict Sussmann because, they say, he abused the trust of senior FBI officials to try to help Clinton win the 2016 presidential election. Jurors' political affiliations, contributions and volunteer work for candidates, including Clinton, repeatedly came up during the jury selection process.\\\"Whether we hate Donald Trump or like him, we have to agree that some things have to be above politics.

Thirteen of them said they supported Fetterman over his two major opponents: Rep. Conor Lamb and state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta.\\u00a0'He's a human being and not as much a politician,' said Mike Schnitgen, 69.'I think that he can beat the Republican in the fall because I think he might appeal to some of the Trumpers,' said Rich Green, 63, while Lamb would 'be seen as part of the swamp' by them.'He's a local. I've always loved his policies. I think he's a genuine person,' said Tye Alu, 24, of Fetterman. 'I'd like to see him win.'Some voters said they were concerned by the news that Fetterman suffered a stroke last week and would have a procedure to implant a pacemaker today, but remained on his side.Wendy Holt, 52, said she was on the fence between Fetterman and Lamb, and that Fetterman's diagnosis gave her a little bit of a pause at the last minute. But she still decided to vote for him because 'his roots are here.''I went with Fetterman, even though he just had a stroke,' said Holt. 'I know what people have to go through to recover and I thought wow, that's a lot of stress.'Some voters said they'd support Lamb. Alexandra Gregory, 70, said she'd support him out of loyalty to his service as her representative in the House.'Connor Lamb has been my district representative and I've been a supporter ever since he ran the first time,' said Gregory.On the Republican side, a few Pennsylvanians said they voted for celebrity surgeon and former TV show host Mehmet Oz because he earned former President Trump's endorsement. The other top-tier candidates facing Oz are former hedge fund manager David McCormick and political commentator Kathy Barnette.'I voted for Oz because Trump's supporting him,' stated Rebekah Blankenship, 59.Carmella Weismantle, 56, wore a t-shirt saying she's proud to be an American. She said she was deciding between Oz and Barnette but decided to go with who Trump picked.'Anybody who Trump endorsed, I'm going to vote for, ' said Weismantle. 'If Trump endorsed him, there's a reason why.'But Dale Ruediger, 62, who was wearing a 2020 Trump shirt, decided to go with Barnette, saying he wasn't sure where Oz stood on some issues, even though Trump endorsed him.'She aligns more with what my views are,' said Ruediger.In the primary for a House race, Democrats appeared split between Summer Lee, a progressive state representative and democratic socialist, and attorney Steve Irwin, who has been endorsed by retiring Rep. Mike Doyle.Holt voted for Lee, a Black woman, since 'she stands for reproductive rights' at a time when the constitutional right to an abortion is under threat and because of her background.'There needs to be some new blood,' said Holt. 'Kind of tired of old white guys.'Pro-Israel groups have supported Irwin, who is Jewish, over Lee. Asked how his position on Israel would affect the race, Irwin told CNN, 'I'm a strong supporter of the state of Israel and the right of Israel to exist. And I've been clear on that. And I've gotten a lot of support because of my support of the state of Israel.'Nelson H., 27, said he is Jewish and voted for Irwin in part because of the candidate's position on Israel.'That's a big thing for me because I see some people on the far left are very anti-Israel, almost the point of anti-Semitism,' said Nelson, who declined to provide his full last name.\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":61,\"topic\":\"politics\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Adrienne Vogt,Maureen Chowdhury,Aditi Sangal,Melissa Macaya,Meg Wagner,Ji Min Lee,Mike Hayes\",\"media\":\"https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/bd20abaf-d509-4b62-b220-96944fa5ba8a.jpg\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":null,\"_score\":1.998283,\"_id\":\"74a03af31649e4f040baf587ef7e088a\"},{\"title\":\"Barnette's quick rise has Republicans reeling over potential upset and what it could mean for November\",\"author\":\"Dan Merica and Gabby Orr, CNN\",\"published_date\":\"2022-05-13 11:03:45\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/13/politics/kathy-barnette-pennsylvania-senate-primary/index.html\",\"clean_url\":\"cnn.com\",\"excerpt\":\"Republicans are watching conservative candidate Kathy Barnette's sudden rise in their party's upcoming Pennsylvania US Senate primary with a mix of unease, wonder and dread.\",\"summary\":\"(CNN)Republicans are watching conservative candidate Kathy Barnette's sudden rise in their party's upcoming Pennsylvania US Senate primary with a mix of unease, wonder and dread. Barnette's late surge in the closely watched contest has turned what was broadly seen as a two-person race between celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz and former hedge fund manager Dave McCormick into a chaotic three-person affair, with Barnette seen as a wild card who has grassroots momentum mere days before the Tuesday contest.The unexpected development has caused even the most influential Republicans to panic, including former President Donald Trump himself, who attempted to quash Barnette's campaign by claiming in a statement Thursday that she is not a viable general election candidate. \\\"Kathy Barnette will never be able to win the General Election against the Radical Left Democrats,\\\" Trump said.Though Trump acknowledged that Barnette, who he described as \\\"not properly explained or vetted,\\\" is poised to \\\"have a wonderful future in the Republican Party,\\\" he reaffirmed his support for Oz and encouraged GOP primary voters to stick with his chosen candidate. \\\"A vote for anyone else in the Primary is a vote against Victory in the Fall!\\\" he said.Like the former President, other Republicans are worried about the myriad unknowns surrounding Barnette, who until this week was barely a household name in Pennsylvania, let alone a Republican candidate garnering national attention. \\\"She is a giant walking question mark,\\\" said one Republican operative working on Senate races. \\\"There has been almost no vetting of her. ... There is a lot that we don't know about her, including basic biographical details.\\\" Oz told Fox host Sean Hannity on Wednesday that Barnette was a \\\"mystery person.\\\"\\\"I don't see any way, any scenario under which she can win a general election,\\\" he told Hannity, who was among those pushing Trump behind the scenes to endorse Oz earlier this spring. One person close to Trump said the former President saw the Oz-Hannity interview as \\\"too heavy-handed\\\" and thought Oz's attacks on Barnette would only make her stock rise further. 'There is certainly fear from some Republicans'The source of Barnette's rise, though, is not a mystery: The persistent campaigner has outflanked Oz and McCormick from the right, using Trump's now-unpopular decision to back the television doctor to rally Pennsylvania's conservative base to her side and benefiting from an alliance with leading Republican gubernatorial hopeful Doug Mastriano. Barnette has effectively stepped into the void created by that grassroots anger and the singular focus that Oz and McCormick have had on each other for weeks.What worries Republicans now is just how much of Barnette's personal and professional background remains a mystery and the limited window in which voters might be informed of any liabilities she would have as a candidate on the ballot this November.\\\"There is certainly fear from some Republicans. The surge happened quickly and sort of out of nowhere,\\\" said a Republican aide focused on Senate races. \\\"She is relatively unknown and unvetted.\\\"While Barnette's campaign website describes her as a \\\"veteran, former adjunct professor of corporate finance, sought-after conference speaker, and conservative political commentator,\\\" little is known about almost all aspects of her professional life.The most in-depth look at Barnette's personal life came in the form of a two-minute campaign ad released in the wake of the leaked draft Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, in which Barnette revealed that she was \\\"the byproduct of rape\\\" after her mother was molested and became pregnant at age 11. Republicans in Washington have also been passing around a Washington Examiner piece titled \\\"Who is Kathy Barnette,\\\" which reports that a series of questions posed to Barnette's campaign manager about the candidate's background -- including about her military service -- went unanswered. Still, not all Republicans are publicly concerned about Barnette's rise.Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told CNN he had no concerns about her emergence in the race -- and he downplayed the idea she would be more vulnerable in a general election matchup. He said he has spoken with her as well.\\\"Everybody's going to attack everybody. But ultimately, the voters are going to choose,\\\" said Scott, who is neutral in the race.And Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, the only US senator who's endorsed Barnette, told CNN that the candidate is \\\"extraordinary\\\" and dismissed the attack that Barnette has not been properly vetted.\\\"Look around the Senate,\\\" Ernst said in the halls of the chamber. \\\"I see a lot of people that I think should have been vetted. But no, I just, I think she is extraordinary.\\\"\\\"Just because you're a political newcomer doesn't mean we write you off,\\\" Ernst added. \\\"I think she's got a great story. It's convincing.\\\"Barnette's connections to Pennsylvania are also largely unknown, and both her book and campaign website are sparse on basic biographical information about the would-be senator. While Barnette ran unopposed in a Republican congressional primary in 2020 only to lose to Democrat Madeleine Dean by 19 percentage points for a congressional seat in the Philadelphia suburbs, the listing for her 2020 book, \\\"Nothing to Lose, Everything to Gain: Being Black and Conservative in America,\\\" said she lived in Virginia.The book features heavily in Barnette's stump speech. The candidate writes that she \\\"grew up on a very small farm in southern Alabama in a one stop-sign town.\\\" The house, she writes, had no running water and had an outhouse. In another passage she writes that \\\"for the majority of blacks in Nichburg, Alabama, and surrounding areas, the goal of each day was sheer survival.\\\" Those who support Barnette and have heard her speak often cite her personal story -- rural upbringing, college, military service and work as a commentator -- as the reason they are backing her.\\\"I was very impressed with her life story,\\\" said Donna DePue, the vice president of the Wyoming County Council of Republican Women, a group that hosted a luncheon for Barnette. \\\"She was never taught to believe she was lesser than. She came across as the real deal. She is not a disgusting RINO and I liked her sincerity.\\\"\\\"I keep telling folks that President Trump is not nearly as politically right as parts of this populist movement -- Kathy Barnette is a manifestation of that. It's MAGA vs. ultra MAGA in Pennsylvania,\\\" said former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who was due to host Barnette on his \\\"War Room\\\" podcast Thursday afternoon. Barnette has also skillfully explained how she, a candidate running in line with Trump and his values, did not get the former President's endorsement, saying at a recent debate that \\\"MAGA does not belong to President Trump\\\" because \\\"our values never, never shifted to President Trump's values\\\" and it was \\\"President Trump who shifted and aligned with our values.\\\"The explanation worked for many Republican activists, who see Oz as the antithesis of the MAGA movement. In response, Oz's and McCormick's campaigns and associated super PACs have quickly worked to stop Barnette's surge. American Leadership PAC, a super PAC backing Oz, posted a video on Wednesday calling Barnette \\\"crazy\\\" and \\\"Pennsylvania's wackiest candidate\\\" and linking her, a Black Republican, with efforts to defund the police. \\\"Her surge is tied to her relationship to state Sen. Doug Mastriano. His supporters are supporting her. ... Mastriano supporters will follow him off a cliff,\\\" said a Republican operative in Pennsylvania. \\\"[I] have a feeling most will stay with her even through the attacks.\\\"Mastriano's rise has set off panic in Republican circles. State Sen. Jake Corman withdrew from the gubernatorial race on Thursday and endorsed former US Rep. Lou Barletta. Mastriano is one of the commonwealth's most outspoken proponents of the falsehood that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.Republicans watching the response to Barnette's rise, however, believe it may be too late for either operation to slow her rise. And the current response may be the extent of the effort to stop her, given the primary is just days away.A source close to the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC closely aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said the group had \\\"no plans to get involved in this primary.\\\" The super PAC's central goal is getting the most electable general election candidate through the primary -- an open question about Barnette. But the timing of her rise has effectively hamstrung the group. For Republicans, the prospect of Barnette winning on Tuesday now turns their focus to a general election with the largely unknown candidate helming one of their most high-profile Senate campaigns. Republicans are buoyant about their chances of taking back the evenly divided Senate in November, powered by President Joe Biden's slumping poll numbers and a favorable environment for the Republican Party.But 2022 would not be the first time an unexpected Republican candidate doomed those chances. Top Republicans are eagerly looking to avoid turning winnable races into clear losses like they did in 2010 and 2012, when far-right, unvetted candidates won primaries but struggled in general elections.A range of Republican operatives told CNN on Thursday that while Barnette could make their work harder in Pennsylvania, she will have a chance in what will likely be a good year for Republicans.\\\"It's absolutely wild, but it still seems early to say she would be a surefire loser in a general,\\\" one of the operatives concluded. \\\"She could explode on the tarmac two weeks after the primary is over. Or she could win.\\\"CNN's Manu Raju and Michael Warren contributed to this report.\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":61,\"topic\":\"politics\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Dan Merica Gaborr,Dan Merica\",\"media\":\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220510220412-kathy-barnette-file-042522-super-tease.jpg\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":null,\"_score\":1.998283,\"_id\":\"6d97ef9002f64d663e9a47f4aea87b0d\"},{\"title\":\"Donald Trump's 2016 election conspiracy theory just took a big hit\",\"author\":\"Analysis by Chris Cillizza, CNN Editor-at-large\",\"published_date\":\"2022-05-31 22:31:33\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/politics/trump-michael-sussman-election-conspiracy/index.html\",\"clean_url\":\"cnn.com\",\"excerpt\":\"For years -- literally -- Donald Trump has insisted that Hillary Clinton engaged in a purposeful conspiracy designed to keep him out of the White House.\",\"summary\":\"(CNN)For years -- literally -- Donald Trump has insisted that Hillary Clinton engaged in a purposeful conspiracy designed to keep him out of the White House. The probe into whether Russia sought to influence the 2016 election (it did) and whether it colluded with the Trump campaign to do so was regularly described by the former President as \\\"the single greatest Witch Hunt in American history.\\\"The real story, according to Trump, was how the counterintelligence investigation into Russia began -- a story that special counsel John Durham was going to get to the bottom of. At the heart of what Trump called the \\\"crime of the century\\\" was an allegation by Durham that Michael Sussman, a lawyer for Clinton's campaign, had lied to the FBI about his own interests in passing along a tip about Trump and Russia.On Tuesday, Sussman was found not guilty of the lying charge by a federal jury. As CNN wrote:\\\"The verdict is a major defeat for Durham and his Justice Department prosecutors, who have spent three years looking for wrongdoing in the Trump-Russia probe.\\\"It remains to be seen when Durham will conclude his probe and whether he will bring charges against anyone else.But what is clear is that the Sussman allegation, which was by far the most high-profile output of Durham's probe to date, amounts to a huge swing and a miss by the special counsel.The Point: It's always been hard to line up Trump's wild claims about the seriousness of the Durham investigation with its output.

Everything that has emerged since has made the horror worse. And while the tragedy of Robb Elementary School is primarily a personal one for families facing the unbearable loss of children at the start of their lives, it is also a national trauma that has intensified over the past seven days as every parent, and many kids, confront fears about whether their towns will be next.Fresh developments over the holiday weekend in the aftermath of the mass killing of 19 elementary school students and two teachers raised new questions about the failure of the law enforcement response as a massacre unfolded inside the school. And despite years of experience to the contrary, President Joe Biden, after traveling to Texas to comfort the bereaved, expressed hopes that \\\"rational\\\" Republicans could join an effort to pass new firearm laws to forestall the inevitability of another community being subject to the same terror.Disturbing new evidence emerged of a child calling 911 for help from a \\\"room full of victims\\\" as police delayed storming the school in an apparent and possibly fatal diversion from active-shooter protocols that have been in place for years. The apparent dispatch audio informs officers on the scene of what is going inside the school and raises questions about the delay in engaging the shooter. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the source of the audio. But it offers a heart-searing window into the horrific moments kids endured inside the classroom, dialing emergency services multiple times and pleading for rescue. The audio adds to the haunting possibility that a faster police response could have saved young lives and will be at the center of a web of official investigations. CNN has previously established that as many as 19 officers were inside the school more than 45 minutes before the suspect was killed and that the school district police chief decided not to order the breach of the classroom. Texas state Sen. Roland Gutierrez told CNN's Dana Bash on \\\"State of the Union\\\" on Sunday that \\\"so many things went wrong here\\\" and that mistakes may have cost lives. He also revealed that Customs and Border Protection forces who arrived at the school were frustrated about the failure to confront the shooter and eventually went in.These emerging strands of inquiry will feature in a US Department of Justice investigation announced Sunday that followed a request from Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin. The probe will likely consider why commonly taught active-shooter protocols established after the Columbine school massacre in 1999, which mandate that assailants are stopped as quickly as possible, were apparently not followed. Other questions loom over training for school district police officers, the quality of their leadership, whether necessary equipment was available at the scene and if rivalries or disconnects among law enforcement agencies hampered the response. First narratives about what happened at chaotic disaster scenes often change as a more full picture of events emerges. But at the outset of the investigation, it already appears something went terribly wrong. CNN Law Enforcement Analyst Jonathan Wackrow, a former Secret Service special agent, described the response as \\\"one of the worst police failures in modern US history.\\\"Unmeasurable tragedyThe first services for the 19 children whose lives were brutally extinguished in their classroom after less than a decade on Earth took place on Monday. The testimony of those left behind encapsulated the severed promise of lives cut short and the courage of parents dealing with the unthinkable. \\\"It brings me joy to know that I had an opportunity to have such a great daughter, and I tried to be the best father that I could be,\\\" said Alfred Garza, the father of 10-year-old Amerie Jo Garza, on Friday. A rosary and visitation was set to take place for Amerie on Monday. Services for another 10-year-old, Maite Rodriguez, who dreamed of being a marine biologist when she grew up, were also set to take place.The loved ones of another victim, 10-year-old Tess Marie Mata, remembered how she hoped to one day go viral on TikTok -- even though she was too young to have an account, CNN's Sara Smart reported. Tess' uncle, Robert Hill, told CNN Monday that she had dreamed of having one of her dance videos go viral on the social media app. But since users must be at least 13 to create an account, she would save her videos to her mother Veronica's account. After she was killed, her family tried to make her dream come true and posted a video of her dancing to Don Toliver's song \\\"No Idea.\\\" As of Monday afternoon, the video on Hill's account had more than 90,000 views, 33,000 likes and 2,000 comments.New hope for change or another false dawn?The emotional agony of the Uvalde shooting may be starting to have a political impact. But the lesson of previous school massacres is that momentum for change soon crashes into the reality of a Republican Party that is dependent on base voters opposed to measures like background checks for purchases or restrictions on assault rifles, which a majority of Americans support. But Republican Sen. John Cornyn, tasked by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell with identifying areas of cooperation with Democrats, says that a group of senators will meet on Tuesday via Zoom during their Memorial Day recess. \\\"There are some things we need to do, and I think we can do, at the national level,\\\" the Texas Republican said, raising the need for better mental health treatment and the possibility of restrictions on what weapons people with records of mental illness could own. He also said there needs to be a national conversation about background checks. \\\"One thing I hope does not happen is that the various parties sort of fall back into their typical talking points,\\\" Cornyn said. Biden, meanwhile, expressed guarded optimism that the latest horror could change the political dynamic. \\\"I think there's a realization on the part of rational Republicans -- and I consider McConnell a rational Republican, Cornyn as well -- there's a recognition on their part they can't continue like this,\\\" he said. Biden said that the Second Amendment, which enshrines the constitutional right to bear arms, was not \\\"absolute\\\" and that there was no rational basis for people to have weapons like assault rifles for hunting or self-defense. \\\"I deliberately did not engage in a debate with any Republicans when we were down consoling the families,\\\" he said. \\\"So I don't know how far it goes. I know it makes no sense to be able to purchase something able to fire up to 300 rounds.\\\" But Biden also stressed the limits of his power. \\\"There's the Constitution. I can't dictate this stuff. ... I can't outlaw a weapon. I can't change the background checks.\\\"The obstacles to Uvalde finally representing a turning point are massive. Former President Donald Trump, for instance, speaking to the National Rifle Association's annual leadership forum on Friday in Texas -- less than 300 miles from the site of the school shooting -- raised the perennial argument that any type of effort to overhaul gun laws is the start of a slippery slope that will inevitably lead to the government seeking to seize the firearms of law-abiding Americans. Such arguments, clearly designed by Trump to bolster his standing with Republican activist voters ahead of a possible 2024 White House run, explain why initial hopes of compromise almost always fade once the initial outrage passes. Still, Nicole Hockley, whose six-year-old son Dylan was killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, believes this time could be different. \\\"I really hope that this is the moment,\\\" Hockley, co-founder and CEO of the Sandy Hook Promise Foundation, said on CNN's \\\"The Situation Room\\\" on Monday. \\\"I think that this second huge, massive shooting at an elementary school is finally a tipping point. ... Members of Congress do want to find a solution. ... I think we are going to see some genuine, sustainable and meaningful movement happen within the next couple of weeks.\\\"Yet this question remains: Is there anything that can convince 10 Republican senators to take a political risk and vote with Democrats to overcome the filibuster blockade that has crushed previous efforts to tighten gun laws?The national traumaA nation exhausted by Covid-19, driven to distraction by rising gas and food prices, and torn by an ongoing effort by Trump to destroy US democracy is further rattled in the wake of the Uvalde tragedy. The deaths of so many defenseless children in one place cuts through in a way that the daily drumbeat of gun killings and mass shootings does not. Schools around the nation have increased their defenses, and every parent knows the flicker of fear caused by hearing a police siren wailing near their child's school.The Memorial Day weekend racked up a familiar deadly toll, with mass shootings in Chattanooga, Tennessee; Taft, Oklahoma; and Henderson, Nevada. (The Gun Violence Archive defines mass shootings as four or more people shot in a single incident.) In another sign of the nation's frayed nerves, spectators in a crowd at a boxing event ran in panic after mistaking a loud noise for an active shooter at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on Sunday. An atmosphere of national mourning over the weekend coincided with always somber ceremonies marking Memorial Day. A sense of loss pervaded Biden's duties as he consoled survivors of Uvalde victims on Sunday, visited the grave of his son Beau in Delaware on Monday morning -- seven years to the day after his death from cancer -- and then led commemorations at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery. It was the first Memorial Day observance since the end of America's longest war, in Afghanistan, and the event is always punctuated with the poignant knowledge that the nation's war dead did not, like those remembering them did, get to grow old. The kids in Uvalde had it even worse. They didn't even get to grow up.\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":61,\"topic\":\"politics\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Analysis Stephen Collinson\",\"media\":\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220527181349-06-uvalde-shooting-memorial-0526-super-tease.jpg\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":null,\"_score\":1.998283,\"_id\":\"bad507d8c30a805a4b41257909fdc85e\"},{\"title\":\"This may be the most dangerous idea in American politics\",\"author\":\"John Blake, CNN\",\"published_date\":\"2022-05-21 10:04:18\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/21/politics/diverse-democracies-mounk-blake-cec/index.html\",\"clean_url\":\"cnn.com\",\"excerpt\":\"Author Yascha Mounk fears an idea he says is making conservative Whites resentful and promotes a dystopian future where Americans will be forever split between two mutually hostile tribes.\",\"summary\":\"An army of commentators have rightly condemned a belief called 'replacement theory,' which a young White man cited before killing 10 people, most of them Black, Saturday at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York. \\n \\n\\n Those who subscribe to the theory \\u2013 many of them White conservatives \\u2013 believe a secret group of elites are using non-White immigrants and Black people to intermarry with and 'outbreed' White people 'until they no longer exist.' \\n \\n\\n But there is a variant of replacement theory that has also moved into the mainstream \\u2013 and it's celebrated by people on the left as well, says Yascha Mounk, author of a provocative new book, 'The Great Experiment: Why Diverse Democracies Fall Apart and How They Can Endure.'\\n\\n\\n 'Over the past days \\u2026 (replacement theory) has, for very good reason, been widely condemned,' Mounk says. 'But the uncomfortable truth is that a less conspiratorial cousin of it has long been embraced in mainstream public discourse. In fact, it is one of the few things that both liberals and conservatives, both Democrats and Republicans, can now agree on.'\\n \\n\\n Mounk is talking about the belief that Democrats will become a permanent political majority in coming years as people of color and non-White immigrants eventually outnumber white Americans.\\n \\n\\n Some progressives may cheer such a projection. But Mounk calls this belief the 'most dangerous idea in American politics.' \\n \\n\\n He says it promotes a dystopian future in which White Americans and people of color are reduced to members of 'mutually hostile tribes,' politicians have little incentive to reach beyond their base, and many Whites panic over the fear of being permanently sidelined. \\n \\n\\n Even so, Mounk, who describes his political values as 'left of center,' offers an optimistic vision of America's future in his new book. He explains why diverse democracies \\u2013 countries with a multitude of racial and ethnic groups \\u2013 sometimes fail, and how the US can succeed. \\n \\n\\n Drawing on lessons from social psychology and countries as diverse as Lebanon and India, Mounk arrives at a surprising conclusion: A genuine, diverse democracy in the US, where all groups are treated fairly, is still a realistic goal. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 'It is far too early to resign ourselves to a vision of the future in which most people will still eye anyone who has a different religion or skin color suspiciously; in which members of different identity groups have little contact with one another in their family lives; in which we all choose to emphasize the differences that divide us rather than the commonalities that could unite us,' Mounk writes in 'The Great Experiment.' \\n \\n\\n This issue is not abstract to Mounk. He was born into a Jewish family in Germany that was victimized by the same forces of hate that have destroyed many democracies. \\n \\n\\n Mounk, an authority on the rise of populism, recently spoke to CNN. His answers were edited for clarity and brevity.\\n \\n\\nYou describe yourself as unfashionably optimistic. Why is that optimism so important when it comes to building a democracy?\\n\\n\\n If you look at the history of deeply diverse societies, they very often fall apart in violent ways or oppress minority groups within them in the most terrible manner. When you look at social psychology, you see how easy people find it to form groups and discriminate in favor of the in-group versus the out-group. So what we're trying to do here is really very hard, and we've often failed throughout American history.\\n \\n\\n But you can look at the current state of our society, and at the changes over the last few decades and recognize that there is a lot which justifies a hard-won optimism. Our country is less segregated and less racist than it used to be. Immigrants from all over the world are integrating very well and making a lot of socioeconomic progress. \\n \\n\\n When you look away from Washington in the heart of our society, we are actually cooperating with each other across ethnic and religious boundaries much more than we used to. None of that should make us complacent, but it should give us confidence that we can build a better society. Without that confidence, the likelihood of failure is going to be much higher.\\n \\n\\nYou say Americans are cooperating more across these boundaries that we used to. What's your evidence for that?\\n\\n\\n I start at the most stark level. As recently as three or four decades ago, a majority of Americans thought interracial marriage was immoral, and that it was immoral for Black and White people to have children together. Today that number is down to the single digits because of real psychological changes in our society and the number of interracial newborns has gone up. \\n \\n\\n Even at the most intimate level, Americans are choosing to intertwine their lives. The same is true when you look at the growth in interracial friendships, the growth in business partners who come from different demographic groups, and the growth of diversity at the top echelon of every American institution.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut if you look at schools, neighborhoods and even communities of worship in this country, it seems like they're still very much racially segregated.\\n\\n\\n If you compare the United States today with 50 years ago, you see a lot more residential integration. You do see that schools in most parts of the country are much more integrated than they used to be, with the exception of particular neighborhoods of the extremely disadvantaged. But the great majority of the schools are much more diverse than they used to be. \\n \\n\\n And with the rise of megachurches in the suburbs of big American metropolises, you do see a very vibrant form of religion, which is generally multi-ethnic, in a way that rarely existed in American congregations.\\n \\n\\nIs it possible to have a genuine vibrant, diverse democracy without a deep commitment to racial integration?\\n\\n\\n Human beings are deeply groupish. It comes naturally to us to form groups and to favor members of their group over those that don't belong to theirs, especially in a deeply diverse society like the United States. We're never going to change that fact. And that's perfectly fine.\\n \\n\\n But precisely because it comes so natural to us to invest particular groups with such importance, we also need to encourage some connective tissue between the different groups in our society. That can take the form of ensuring that people are educated together, that they come to have a deeper, mutual understanding and hopefully a mutual affection. \\n \\n\\n It can take the form of patriotism which allows us to have solidarity with each other even if we differ on religion, national origin or skin color. And it also has to include the right for each individual to decide how much importance that they want to give to the group in which they were raised.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the book you cite two cities in India that were populated by both Muslims and Hindus. One was devasted by violence between the two groups, and the other wasn't. What was the difference between the two, and what does that story illustrate about building a diverse democracy? \\n\\n\\n Tragically we've seen in India violent riots between Hindus and Muslims, which often kill a lot of people. But when you look more closely, you also see some interesting contrasts. There are two mid-sized cities in India which are about two-thirds Hindu and one-third Muslims. They have similar political histories and yet we see that one city has experienced an extreme amount of so-called inter-communal violence, whereas the other has actually managed to keep the peace. \\n \\n\\n Both cities had a rich associational life. They had a lot of trade unions, literature clubs and all kinds of different places where citizens can meet and debate with each other. But in in one city, Hindus and Muslimas have separate trade unions, and separate book clubs. In the other, many, but not all, have members from both groups. \\n \\n\\n When tensions have run high, that historically made the crucial difference. Because in one city, when rumors spread within each association, there is no link of trust between the communities. And so when Hindus heard some rumors about a young boy being killed by Muslims, they might have been moved to take revenge based on this false rumor. \\n \\n\\n In the other city, you have all of these interpersonal links. You have people to trust each other across the communities. And so, in moments of high political tension when those rumors were flying around, somebody could say, 'Look, this is not true. I've talked to all the people in my community. I know that this didn't happen. Let's just try to find a way to reduce these tensions without unnecessary bloodshed.' It shows us the importance of bridging social capital.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Many Americans live in their own social media echo chambers. We go back to our own like-minded communities. How do we replicate what happened in that Indian city here?\\n\\n\\n Over the last decade, millions of Americans have made choices that have made it (the country) more integrated than it was. We see in particular the rise of suburbs, some upper-middle and some lower middle-class communities, which are more integrated than they were 40 years ago. \\n \\n\\n The members of Little Leagues and of neighborhood associations encounter each other ethnic and religious boundaries much more than they had a while ago. There's important work in interfaith space, and by community organizers to try to connect people to each other. \\n \\n\\n Ultimately this will depend on the decision that ultimately all Americans make in their individual lives. Do we stay within the comfort zone that we've grown up in, or do we venture out and make new friendships and build new links with people who come from different communities? \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow much does your personal history shape your interest in this topic?\\n\\n\\n It has in two important respects. The first is that I'm Jewish and I grew up in Germany. My family has experienced what it means to be at the wrong end of conflict between groups for three generations. My great-grandparents perished in the Holocaust. My grandparents lost most of their families and were displaced. My own parents, when they were in their late teens and early 20s, were thrown out of a country they grew up in, Poland, because of a state-sponsored, anti-Semitic campaign. \\n \\n\\n And so, I'm intimately aware that a society that could seem relatively peaceful, in which people have gotten along for significant period of time, can suddenly erupt into the most terrifying violence.\\n \\n\\nWhat would you say to a reader who tells you, \\u2018I'm pessimistic about prospects for a thriving, diverse democracy. Tell me how to make it work.'\\n\\n\\n We have no choice but to make it work because a brief glance at history will tell you how terrible the alternative it is \\u2013 how violent, how unstable, how unjust the future will be if we fail to make diverse democracies work. \\n \\n\\n We should recognize that people will always remain members of cultural religious and ethnic groups and that they can help to make up the beauty of our country. But we can also do what we can as individuals, as members of associations, of educational institutions and as citizens to create more connective tissue between American citizens from different walks of life, to make sure that people interact in school, in sports teams, in neighborhood associations and to ensure that we come to a deeper understanding of each other.\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":61,\"topic\":\"politics\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"John Blake\",\"media\":\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220519153435-01-replacement-theory-mounk.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":null,\"_score\":1.998283,\"_id\":\"2988265971cd2f91c106598db04a525e\"},{\"title\":\"Trump-backed Rep.

His win sets up a showdown with Democratic former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley, who is vying to make history by becoming North Carolina's first Black senator.With the Senate split evenly between 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans, the GOP's hopes of winning a majority in November rest in part on its ability to hold onto the seats of retiring Republicans in two swing states that held primaries Tuesday: North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Budd had powerful support in the Republican primary. He was the first non-incumbent who Trump endorsed in the 2022 cycle, and he was also backed by the conservative Club for Growth's political arm, which spent more than $11 million bolstering Budd and casting McCrory as too liberal. The Club for Growth and Trump have been at odds in other races, including Ohio and Pennsylvania. Trump's endorsement was not enough to clear the field. The former President told former Rep.

The complaint alleges that Wynn was working as an agent on behalf of the People's Republic of China and a former PRC official, Sun Lijun.\\\"Specifically, at the request of Sun, and on behalf of the PRC, the Defendant conveyed to former President Donald J. Trump and his Administration ('the Trump Administration') the PRC's request to remove from the country a PRC national who had sought political asylum in the United States,\\\" the complaint, filed Tuesday in DC federal court, says. \\\"In so doing, from at least June 2017 through at least August 2017, the Defendant acted as an agent for foreign principals Sun and the PRC and engaged in political activities on their behalf in the United States.\\\" The Justice Department says it sent Wynn letters in May 2018, October 2021 and April 2022 informing him of his obligation to register under FARA, and now is seeking an injunction from the court requiring Wynn to do so. The move to use a civil lawsuit to force a FARA registration is extremely rare, and, according to the DOJ news release unveiling the complaint, it is the first time in three decades that the Department has filed this kind of affirmative civil lawsuit. The DOJ contends that Wynn, in his alleged work on behalf of the PRC, was motivated \\\"by his desire to protect his business interests\\\" in China, with prosecutors pointing specifically to the casinos Wynn operated in Macau. Wynn's attorneys, in a Tuesday statement to CNN, denied that he ever acted as an agent of the Chinese government and said he had no obligation to register under FARA. \\\"We respectfully disagree with the Department of Justice's legal interpretation of FARA and look forward to proving our case in court,\\\" Wynn's attorneys, Reid H. Weingarten and Brian M. Heberlig, said.The complaint alleges that Wynn was asked in June 2017 to help on the lobbying effort by Elliott Broidy, who, like Wynn, is a former finance chairman of the Republican National Committee. \\\"Broidy told the Defendant that the PRC national was a criminal wanted by the PRC who was hiding in the United States, that the PRC wanted him arrested, and that his visa was due to expire soon,\\\" the complaint said. \\\"Broidy informed the Defendant that Broidy had received this information from Sun of the PRC's Ministry of Public Security and that Sun requested the Defendant's help in bringing the issue to the attention of the Trump Administration.\\\" Broidy pleaded guilty in 2020 to one count of conspiracy, in a case concerning both the effort to remove the PRC national and a separate effort aimed at stopping a criminal investigation into massive fraud at a Malaysian investment fund.The new civil lawsuit filed against Wynn recounts texts that Wynn's wife allegedly received and sent on his behalf about the alleged lobbying effort. \\\"During a dinner on or about June 27, 2017 with then-President Trump and other Administration officials in Washington, D.C., the Defendant conveyed to then-President Trump the PRC's desire to have the PRC national removed from the United States and provided the PRC national's passport photos to then-President Trump's secretary,\\\" the complaint said. The complaint quotes a text from Broidy sent after the dinner to Wynn, via Wynn's wife, in which Broidy said that Sun was \\\"extremely pleased and said that President Xi Jinping appreciates [the Defendant's] assistance.\\\" In addition to other alleged texts from Broidy expressing Sun's gratefulness for Wynn's help, the complaint says that Wynn had several calls with Sun about the renewal of the PRC national's visa. \\\"The Defendant mentioned his business interests in Macau to Sun on multiple phone calls,\\\" the complaint says. Additionally, the DOJ alleges that Wynn on several occasions brought up the PRC national in conversations with White House officials and in at least one meeting with Trump himself, as well as in a phone call Wynn and Broidy had with Trump from Broidy's yacht. \\\"The efforts to have the PRC national removed ultimately were unsuccessful,\\\" the complaint says. \\\"Sun continued to contact the Defendant through approximately October 2017, at which point the Defendant informed Sun that he had made U.S. Government officials aware of the request, that the Defendant was not able to provide any more assistance, and that Sun should stop contacting him.\\\" In 2018, Wynn stepped down as chief executive of Wynn Resorts and as finance chair of the RNC amid allegations of sexual misconduct at his casino company.

Gov. John Fetterman, in the hospital since last week and a late-breaking Covid-19 diagnosis that will keep state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who's running unopposed for the Democratic gubernatorial nod, off the trail on election night. The night's most closely watched race is Pennsylvania's GOP Senate contest, which encapsulates the complex crosswinds facing the Republican Party as former President Donald Trump looks for a victory from his chosen candidate, celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, to cement his influence over the party in preparation for a possible 2024 White House bid. Oz had been locked in an expensive battle with former hedge fund executive Dave McCormick. But political commentator Kathy Barnette, who has drawn the support of Trump backers suspicious of Oz's ideological shifts, stunned the political world with a late surge that upended the race in the final weeks as she tries to become the first Black Republican woman elected to the Senate. The contest to replace retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey, which could be Democrats' best chance of flipping a seat this fall, has earned the most attention. It will not only test the power of Trump's endorsement through Oz, but also whether the MAGA movement he created is beginning to outrun him as candidates like Barnette claim that label even without the former President's backing. In his final efforts to galvanize support for Oz, Trump argued that Barnette is an unvetted, political unknown who could lead the GOP to a loss in November. \\\"Winning this Senate seat is a must,\\\" Trump said during a tele-rally for Oz Monday night. But Barnette, who argued in one debate that the MAGA label does not belong to Trump, has not been shy about striking back. On Monday, she said that she is able to \\\"get people Donald Trump was not able to get\\\" and claimed to be more electable than him based on the results of her previous congressional race, which she lost.Both Barnette and state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who got a late endorsement from Trump after he was already well-positioned to win the gubernatorial nod, have championed Trump's lies that voter fraud was rampant in the 2020 presidential election. Mastriano, who is seeking an office that would allow him sway over the state's electors in the 2024 presidential contest, took a leading role in amplifying those false claims, and spent more than $3,000 from his campaign account to charter buses to Washington ahead of the January 6, 2021, \\\"Stop the Steal\\\" rally that preceded the attack on the US Capitol, according to state campaign finance records.In the immediate aftermath of the insurrection, Mastriano condemned the violence in a video posted on Facebook, but video and pictures from the event show him near the Capitol, raising questions about his involvement. Barnette attended the \\\"Stop the Steal\\\" rally before the riot at the Capitol, but a spokesperson has said she did not enter the Capitol building. She did not participate in any destruction of property, her campaign told CNN.Still, McCormick said Tuesday that Barnette needs to answer questions about what she was doing on January 6 after pictures emerged on social media showing her marching toward the Capitol that day: \\\"The stakes for our country, and for the Republican Party in picking the right person, are really significant,\\\" he told reporters. CNN's KFile previously reported Barnette has a history of bigoted statements against Muslims and the LGBTQ community and that she falsely spread the conspiracy that former President Barack Obama is Muslim.Among the Democrats vying for the Senate seat, Fetterman is widely viewed as the front-runner even as US Rep. Conor Lamb, running on his more moderate credentials, has cast himself as a more viable candidate in November. Fetterman's campaign revealed on Sunday that he had suffered from a stroke last week, injecting a level of uncertainty into the race even as his campaign says he is headed toward a full recovery. North Carolina and Idaho In addition to Pennsylvania, Trump has also endorsed in key GOP contests in Idaho and North Carolina. Rep. Ted Budd, whom Trump had endorsed, will win the GOP nomination to replace retiring North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, CNN projected Tuesday. Trump endorsed Budd nearly a year ago, but his candidacy was slow to take off and he struggled to break away from former Gov. Pat McCrory and Rep. Mark Walker in the primary. Heavy spending from the Club for Growth's political action committee ultimately boosted the conservative congressman, who backed voting to toss out the electoral results in Arizona and Pennsylvania in January 2021. Democrat Cheri Beasley, who was the first Black woman to lead the North Carolina Supreme Court as chief justice, will be the party's Senate nominee in the state, CNN projected Tuesday. Her main rivals had dropped out of the primary before Tuesday. Also in North Carolina, Trump has stood by GOP Rep. Madison Cawthorn through a raft of recent scandals, even as GOP Sen. Thom Tillis has backed state Sen. Chuck Edwards, one of Cawthorn's primary challengers. In Idaho, Trump has backed Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin in her unusual bid to unseat Gov. Brad Little, but he hasn't done much to elevate her candidacy beyond his initial endorsement. McGeachin sought to raise her profile last year by issuing an executive order barring mask mandates when Little was absent from the state. Little then accused her of attempting to deploy the state's National Guard to the US-Mexico border while he was out of state visiting that region. Little repealed each change she sought while he was out of state, criticizing her maneuvers as political stunts.A test for Biden tooFarther west, Democrats are closely watching a House primary in Oregon's newly drawn 5th Congressional District, where Oregon Rep. Kurt Schrader is fending off a challenge from his left from Jamie McLeod-Skinner, who has received a relatively modest boost from progressive outside groups, led by the Working Families Party.Schrader, who was President Joe Biden's first congressional endorsement of 2022, has angered some of his fellow Democrats by voting against the American Rescue Plan, Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid relief package, and a measure in the President's Build Back Better package to allow the government to negotiate the price of pharmaceutical drugs, which would dramatically lower prices.Schrader pushed an alternative provision and ultimately voted for full bill, but not before joining a group of nine moderates in an effort to decouple it from the bipartisan infrastructure bill -- a tactical step that ultimately helped doom Build Back Better, Biden's would-be signature legislation -- in the Senate.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story mischaracterized the potential historic significance of Barnette winning the Pennsylvania Senate seat.

They are actively making the situation worse, creating an atmosphere in which Black Americans were gunned down while doing their Saturday shopping. \\n \\n\\n More than half a century since the greatest gains of the civil rights movement and nearly a decade and a half since the election of the first Black President, a growing roster of killings motivated by racial rage \\u2013 not just against Black Americans but against Jews and Hispanics as well \\u2013 appears to augur a frightening new passage of history in a nation that is internally estranged.\\n \\n\\n This reality set off a day of agony and mourning in Buffalo and in minority communities nationwide on Sunday. \\n \\n\\n 'Someone drove from hundreds of miles away, someone not from this community, that did not know this community, that came here to take as many Black lives as possible, who did this in a willful, premeditated fashion,' Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said on CBS's 'Face the Nation.'\\n \\n\\n There will be claims that the Buffalo shooting was an isolated incident perpetrated by a sick extremist. But it is becoming harder to make such arguments. The 2015 massacre of worshippers at a Black church in Charleston, South Carolina, the 2018 mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, and the 2019 killings at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, were all also motivated by racial hate.\\n \\n\\n These contemporary trends, which confirm years of FBI warnings that White supremacist terrorism is America's chief domestic threat, also pose deep questions. \\n \\n\\n For instance, what level of culpability is there for conservative media networks that advance inflammatory material in primetime like the 'Great Replacement Theory,' which alleges that there is an organized plot to replace White Americans with Black, Hispanic and Jewish voters? That line of racial subversion appears to have influenced Buffalo suspect Payton Gendron, according to police and a copy of what appears to be his 180-page manifesto, which was obtained by CNN. \\n \\n\\n In the document, attributed to Gendron, he talks about his perception of the dwindling size of the White population and claims of ethnic and cultural replacement of Whites. An official familiar with the investigation said Gendron, who is charged with first degree murder, made statements that were filled with hate toward the Black community after his arrest. Investigators also uncovered other information from search warrants and other methods indicating the alleged shooter was 'studying' previous hate attacks and shootings.\\n \\n\\n While there is no evidence so far that the shooter in Buffalo had a partisan motive, the attack came at a time when racial demagoguery and equivocation about White extremism have seeped into politics, fostered by politicians such as ex-President Donald Trump. \\n \\n\\n And the massacre again plunges social media companies, on whose networks such hate sometimes percolates, into a fierce controversy over the extent to which free speech should be regulated to avoid promoting extremist ideology that kills. \\n \\n\\n 'This spreads like a virus. And that's why I'm calling on the CEOs of all the social media platforms to examine their policies and to be able to look me in the eye and tell me that everything is being done that they can to make sure that this information is not spread,' New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul said on CNN's 'State of the Union' on Sunday.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNY governor calls on social media companies to police platforms\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 'They have to be able to identify when information like this \\u2013 the second it hits the platform, it needs to be taken down, because this is spreading like wildfire. These theories that result in the radicalization of a young person sitting in their house is deeply scary and something that has to be dealt with.'\\n \\n\\n The Buffalo shooting also triggered the familiar and futile ritual of politicians offering prayers for the victims, accompanied by Democratic demands for gun control and Republican obfuscating on the issue of whether guns like the one used in Saturday's attack should be legal. \\n \\n\\n Nothing that has happened since the gunman burst into the supermarket suggests that moderate, limited reforms to firearms law have any chance of getting around the GOP logjam caused by the Senate filibuster. Some Democrats might also rather not vote on gun control measures in a midterm election year. So there is every reason to believe that Buffalo will join other cities whose names become emblems for the country's unwillingness to come to agreement on how to prevent mass shootings.\\n \\n\\n While the Buffalo attack was the most horrific outburst of gun violence this weekend, it was far from the only such bloodshed. Multiple people were shot in a church in Orange County, California. Up to 20 people were shot just hours apart in several outbursts of gunfire in Milwaukee on Friday night near an NBA Playoffs game. In Chicago on Saturday evening, a 16-year-old was shot and killed near 'The Bean' public art display in Millennium Park.\\n \\n\\n America is hurting in more ways than one, and it's likely the horror in Buffalo will exacerbate feelings of insecurity \\u2013 in all its forms \\u2013 that many Americans are experiencing.\\n \\n\\n Parents cannot find baby formula. High inflation, which has led to soaring food prices and almost daily records set for the cost of a gallon of gas, is making life miserable for millions of Americans. It has also confounded the White House's initial diagnosis that the high cost of living was a 'transitory' result of the pandemic and most of its efforts to ease the pressure.\\n \\n\\n More than two years of successive waves of Covid-19 have killed one million people in the US, left many more exhausted and tore new political divides over vaccines and masking in a nation that seems to be splitting into conservative and liberal tribes. And the scars of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol are felt in this year's midterm elections, as candidates up and down the Republican ticket whitewash what happened that day while repeating Trump's lies about a stolen election.\\n \\n\\n The current tempestuous political mood might be the rule rather than the exception, but the acrimony and division is about to get even worse when the Supreme Court is expected to hand down a major abortion ruling in the next few weeks. Nationwide abortion rights marches this weekend, in response to the draft opinion striking down Roe v. Wade, underscored how the country is on the cusp of another major battle. If the final ruling does gut the nationwide right to an abortion and the issue is sent back to the states, the cultural divisions between red and blue states and cities and rural areas will ensure it's a fight that rages for decades. \\n \\n\\n The existential feud between liberal and conservative visions of the country is taking place in a febrile atmosphere deliberately fomented by Trump for his own political gain. The ex-President's lies about election fraud and his attempted coup to stay in power have poisoned the political process and made this moment in history even more fragile. His likely 2024 presidential campaign could stretch the country even closer to a breaking point \\u2013 and further strain racial and social cohesion.\\n \\n\\n President Joe Biden, who was motivated to run in part by disgust at Trump's blaming of 'both sides' for violence at White supremacists' 2017 march in Charlottesville, Virginia, condemned the motivations behind the attack in Buffalo.\\n \\n\\n 'We must all work together to address the hate that remains a stain on the soul of America. Our hearts are heavy once again, but our resolve must never waver,' the President said at the National Peace Officers Memorial Service on Sunday.\\n \\n\\n Biden and first lady Jill Biden plan to travel to Buffalo to meet the families of victims of the shooting on Tuesday, a White House official said. The visit will likely stir memories of then-President Barack Obama's moving visit to Charleston, when he broke into 'Amazing Grace' during a eulogy for Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who was killed in the 2015 massacre.\\n \\n\\n Biden does not share Obama's eloquence or historic significance as a barrier breaker. And seven years on, amidst the political convulsions that have occurred since, he faces an even tougher task in leading a fractured nation toward common ground.\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":61,\"topic\":\"politics\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Analysis Stephen Collinson\",\"media\":\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220515222225-02-buffalo-shooting-mourning-0515.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":null,\"_score\":1.998283,\"_id\":\"cfcb78728b5b11117f6fd5bd925c5fa8\"},{\"title\":\"House expected to vote Tuesday on $40 billion Ukraine aid bill\",\"author\":\"Clare Foran, Kristin Wilson and Annie Grayer, CNN\",\"published_date\":\"2022-05-10 19:37:43\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/10/politics/house-vote-ukraine-aid-bill/index.html\",\"clean_url\":\"cnn.com\",\"excerpt\":\"The Democratic-led House of Representatives is expected to vote Tuesday evening on a nearly $40 billion bill to deliver aid to Ukraine as it continues to face Russia's brutal assault.\",\"summary\":\"(CNN)The Democratic-led House of Representatives is expected to vote Tuesday evening on a nearly $40 billion bill to deliver aid to Ukraine as it continues to face Russia's brutal assault.Lawmakers unveiled bill text on Tuesday ahead of a planned vote later in the day on the legislation, which is expected to have bipartisan support. Aid to Ukraine has been a rare bright spot of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill with Democrats and Republicans largely rallying around a call to help the nation as it faces Russian attack.

But there's a time there where you just don't accept that at all. That you're back. You can't understand that you're actually free,\\\" he said.Reed, an American citizen and former Marine, was sentenced to nine years in prison in July 2020 after being accused of endangering the \\\"life and health\\\" of Russian police officers in an altercation the previous year. He and his family have denied the charges against him.As part of a prisoner exchange with the US for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian smuggler convicted of conspiring to import cocaine, Reed was freed from Russia in late April. The US commuted Yaroshenko's sentence.During the summer of 2019, Reed traveled to Moscow planning to spend it with his girlfriend, a lawyer named Lina Tsybulnik. After the couple attended a party one evening that included heavy drinking, Reed blacked out and became ill on the side of the road before police arrived on the scene and took him to the station lobby, he told CNN.Reed said he slept in the lobby and expected to leave in the morning; but when he was waiting to get a ride home from his girlfriend, a change of duty took place.Reed recalled: \\\"The new officers came in with a new police chief. He saw that I was speaking English with the duty there. ... And after about three minutes, they came back and told me that I could not leave. I did try to ask them why. But they wouldn't answer me about that.\\\"Reed said officers from FSB, the successor organization to the KGB, came in about 10 minutes later.When Tsybulnik arrived at the station, Reed said, the officers claimed that he'd been arrested for assaulting officers inside the police station. But when Tsybulnik asked for camera footage, the police stopped speaking to them. The police later changed their story to say that Reed assaulted the officers in the police car on the way to the station, he said.\\\"Lina was following the police car to the police station. And she said, you know, obviously that didn't happen,\\\" Reed recalled. \\\"My defense team did end up getting video from the road where this had supposedly happened, and they were able to prove that none of that happened.\\\"Reed also believes he was beaten by officers while he was passed out in the station.Reed's life inside Russian prisonDuring his time as a prisoner in Russia, Reed refused to admit any guilt. He refused to participate in work while at a work camp, which led to solitary confinement. And he took part in hunger strikes to protest the labor camp and get medical attention.Time in prison took a physical toll. Reed says he lost 45 pounds and was coughing up blood for a span of months, fearing he had caught Covid or tuberculosis.Asked if he ever came close to a breaking point, Reed told Tapper, \\\"No. And to be honest with you -- the longer that I was in there, the more dedicated I was to not allowing them to break me.\\\"\\\"Maybe I would've died. But psychologically, they never would've broken me,\\\" he added.Reed also told Tapper he believed he was sent to the psychiatric treatment facility as a punishment for his continued push to appeal his conviction. He described the facility: \\\"There was blood all over the wall there -- where prisoners had killed themselves, or killed other prisoners, or attempted to do that.\\\" \\\"The toilet's just a hole in the floor. And there's, you know, crap everywhere, all over the floor, on the walls. There's people in there also that walk around that look like zombies,\\\" he continued. He said he did not sleep for a couple of days out of fear of what the people in his cell might do to him. Inside prison, Reed denied himself the hope of getting out. \\\"And a lot of people are not going to like what I'm gonna say about this, but I kind of viewed their having hope as being a weakness,\\\" he said. \\\"So, I did not want to have that hope of, like, me, you know, being released somehow and then have that taken from me.\\\"\\\"I wouldn't let myself hope,\\\" he later remarked.The swapOnce Russia's war on Ukraine began earlier this year, Reed's despair deepened. In his interview with Tapper, he recalled thinking, \\\"OK, now there's no way that I'm ever getting out of here.\\\"But as the war ensued, Reed was transferred from a hospital to an FSB prison in Moscow. There, a US State Department official told him he would probably be released. Reed, however, remained skeptical.Behind the scenes, officials both inside and outside the US government had for years been working to get Reed released.One morning at the FSB prison, Reed was picked up in an FSB van and put on a plane headed for Turkey. Once the plane was on the tarmac in Turkey, Reed said, \\\"I had no idea what was going on.\\\" Russian FSB officers onboard told Reed how the swap would work: \\\"We have a man there in America. American jet will fly here. He will land next to us. You will leave the plane. He will leave the plane. You will cross each other on the runway and get in your own plane,\\\" Reed recalled.\\\"I was, like, 'No,'\\\" Reed said with a laugh. \\\"Like, this guy has to be screwin' with me.\\\"Then Roger Carstens, the US special envoy for hostage affairs, came onto the plane to identify him. After that, both he and Yaroshenko crossed one another on the tarmac.Leaving Turkey, Reed says he ate a steak onboard and called his mom and dad.Last month's swap, one administration official previously told CNN, was the culmination of \\\"months and months of hard careful work across the US government\\\" that took place against the backdrop of growing tensions between Washington and Moscow -- exacerbated dramatically by Russia's brutal war on Ukraine.It was the combination of factors around Reed's case -- including his deteriorating health in prison, his family's consistent activism, which led to a meeting with President Joe Biden, and the situation in Ukraine -- that led Biden to authorize the swap for Yaroshenko, a source told CNN last month.The Reeds say they owe lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for helping make the swap happen, including Texas Republican Rep. August Pfluger, and the Biden administration.\\\"This is not political,\\\" Trevor's father, Joey Reed, told Tapper. \\\"When they took Trevor, they didn't take a Republican or a Democrat. They took an American, and a veteran at that. And we need to start looking at these cases as being an attack on America. And let's get 'em home. And if we can't force them, we should trade or do whatever we need to do to get our Americans home.\\\"Trevor Reed also thanked the press for covering his detention and credited the reporting for helping secure his return to the United States. Throughout much of Reed's detention, his parents frequently appeared before the press advocating their son's return. Reed said his release last month \\\"would have never happened\\\" if the American press did not cover and bring public awareness to his imprisonment.\\\"In (the) US, news media played a critical role in in accomplishing all of that. So, CNN, ABC, Fox News -- everyone who covered that -- I want to thank them for doing that,\\\" he continued. \\\"And I want to say, keep up the good work and continue to do that with other hostages. ... That's something, unfortunately, that our government needs to function.\\\" But the Reed family also said some lawmakers brushed off their requests because the family was not from their congressional district. And Joey Reed said the family \\\"heard nothing from the Marine Corps\\\" or any Marine Corps groups in response to their son's arrest.\\\"We felt pretty let down by the Marine Corps,\\\" Joey Reed said. \\\"There's millions of former Marines. Think of the voting power that you would have. Think of the voice you would have. And you can't use any of that for another Marine?\\\"Marine Corps spokesperson Maj. Jim Stenger told CNN: \\\"Trevor Reed served his country honorably as a Marine and we thank him for his service. We are happy he has returned home safely and wish him and his family the best as they reunite.\\\"Trevor Reed also said he does not believe US participation in prisoner swaps to bring Americans home should be controversial.While some critics say US participation in the swaps could incentivize foreign governments to hold Americans hostage or prisoner under false charges as a form of leverage, Reed said these nations are \\\"going to continue to do that as long as American citizens travel there.\\\" \\\"The thing that you have to understand is countries like North Korea -- Russia now, obviously, China, Syria, Iran, Venezuela -- countries like that are going to take Americans hostage no matter what,\\\" Reed said. \\\"And even if they don't receive some type of exchange for those prisoners, they will do that anyway just out of pure malice just to show the United States that, 'We took your citizens.'\\\" Reed also said that what sets the US apart from other nations is its willingness to bring Americans home when they're being held hostage or are wrongfully imprisoned abroad. \\\"(The) United States went out and made the ethical decision to exchange prisoners to get their innocent Americans out of that country, even while exchanging them for someone who's more high-profile and valuable in the United States,\\\" Reed said, later adding that \\\"the Russians, the Chinese, Venezuelans, Iran, Syria, North Korea -- none of them ever in their whole history have or ever would make an exchange for a prisoner who is just an average one of their citizens. They would never do that. And that's what sets the United States apart.\\\" Meanwhile, two other Americans, Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner, remain detained in Russia.A senior administration official told CNN last month that they do not necessarily see Reed's successful repatriation as translating to momentum for Whelan's and Griner's cases but said the US government will continue to press for their release, and the channel for potential swaps will remain open.Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to Griner's wife, Cherelle Griner, last week.According to a senior State Department official, the top US diplomat relayed that Griner's release is a top priority for the department and has his full attention.For Reed, advocating for the other Americans imprisoned abroad now seems to be forming into a new mission.\\\"We need to do absolutely everything we can, as Americans, to advocate for those Americans who are being held illegally overseas and do every single thing we can possible to get them out,\\\" Reed told CNN. \\\"When they told me that I was leaving, I thought that Paul (Whelan) was leaving with me. And when I found out that they left him here, it was tough.\\\"Reed said that while he realizes there's nothing he could have done to bring Whelan with him, \\\"the fact is that the United States should have gotten him out, and we have to get him out at any cost.\\\"CNN's Devan Cole contributed to this report.\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":61,\"topic\":\"politics\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Maegan Vazquez\",\"media\":\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220520145929-trevor-reed-detainment-still-super-tease.jpg\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":null,\"_score\":1.998283,\"_id\":\"97ebcfa307366c8be7c86f201420dcd3\"},{\"title\":\"Manchin, Republican lawmakers grill Interior chief over oil and gas drilling plans amid high prices\",\"author\":\"Ella Nilsen and Liz Stark, CNN\",\"published_date\":\"2022-05-19 18:45:49\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/19/politics/haaland-manchin-oil-gas-drilling-hearing-climate/index.html\",\"clean_url\":\"cnn.com\",\"excerpt\":\"Sen.

Joe Manchin and Republicans on the committee expressed concern that the Department of Interior appeared to be delaying holding more oil and gas lease sales just as gasoline prices are surging in the US. \\n \\n\\n 'The President says he wants his administration to encourage more American energy,' said Sen. John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming. 'Instead your department, Madam Secretary, stalls, postpones and kills oil and natural gas lease sales. Your department is undermining domestic energy production, not expediting it.'\\n \\n\\n Energy experts have told CNN that high gas prices cannot be solved by drilling more oil in the US.\\n \\n\\n Haaland told the committee the department has no deadline to start leasing under a new program, which will likely lead to a gap between the current program and the new one, during which the federal government cannot hold offshore oil and gas lease sales. \\n \\n\\n Both she and Deputy Interior Secretary Tommy Beaudreau told lawmakers that the process of drafting a five-year plan is taking longer as the department tries to be 'deliberate.' \\n \\n\\n 'It is appropriate for us to take a step, be deliberate as we think about future potential leasing described in the 5-year program,' Beaudreau told Manchin, the committee's chair. 'By the end of June, we'll take step number two in a three-step process. No decisions about leasing will be made until step number three.' \\n \\n\\n That answer didn't appear to satisfy Manchin, the senator from West Virginia who is Democrats' swing vote on energy and climate legislation. \\n \\n\\n Manchin told Interior officials they were taking 'a lot longer than the deadline' to get their new five-year plan done. \\n \\n\\n 'We're getting this at the last possible day, the last possible minute, knowing that there's other steps to go through,' Manchin said. 'The timing is not right that you've taken as long as you possibly could.' \\n \\n\\n Haaland said even after the program proposal comes out by June 30, it will take another 150 days to complete public comment and environmental review before lease sales can be held. \\n \\n\\n 'I don't think there is an actual deadline' to begin new offshore leasing, she told Sen. James Lankford, a Republican from Oklahoma. \\n \\n\\n 'That's the concern all of us have, actually that there's no deadline,' Lankford responded. 'That the proposal to talk about it is coming on the date it should be done, and that this is going to stretch out for the next 2-3 years of talking about it. We're trying to figure out when's the deadline to actually start leasing.' \\n \\n\\n The Biden administration announced last week it would cancel three upcoming offshore oil and gas leases \\u2013 two in the Gulf of Mexico and one in Alaska \\u2013 over a lack of industry interest and legal delays. \\n \\n\\n The cancellation of the previously planned Cook Inlet sale in Alaska, as well as the lease sales in the Gulf, ensures that millions of acres of offshore waters will not be developed for oil and gas \\u2013 a significant victory for climate advocates. While the administration announced it would restart a dramatically smaller area of onshore oil and gas leases in April, the offshore cancellations threw the future of the federal government's offshore oil and gas leasing this year into doubt. \\n \\n\\n The move rankled Republicans and Manchin, who expressed his displeasure at Thursday's hearing. \\n \\n\\n 'I'm sorry to say it has become crystal clear that the \\u2018pause' is in fact a \\u2018ban,'' Manchin said of the department's initial temporary pause on new oil and gas leasing, which has since ended.\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":61,\"topic\":\"politics\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Ella Nilsen Liz Stark,Ella Nilsen,Liz Stark\",\"media\":\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220519141820-deb-haaland-file-051622.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@cnnpolitics\",\"_score\":1.998283,\"_id\":\"d51c68a0d9abe38a77fdd6cf2c59aeee\"},{\"title\":\"Republican Rep.

Adam Kinzinger of Illinois said Sunday that he's open to supporting a federal ban on AR-15 rifles, saying his position on the issue has changed in the wake of a mass shooting at a Texas elementary school last week that left 19 children and two teachers dead. \\\"Look, I have opposed a ban, you know, fairly recently. I think I'm open to a ban now. It's going to depend on what it looks like because there's a lot of nuances on what constitutes, you know, certain things,\\\" Kinzinger told CNN's Dana Bash on \\\"State of the Union\\\" when asked if he still opposed \\\"a ban on the kind of assault weapons that were used in the shooting.\\\"Kinzinger noted that an \\\"extra license,\\\" or \\\"extra training\\\" may be required to own such weapons. But he said it was up to those who support the Second Amendment, like himself, to also be offering solutions to the discussion.\\\"We have to be coming to the table with ways to mitigate 18-year-olds buying these guns and walking into schools -- my side's not doing that,\\\" said the congressman, who's not running for reelection in the fall. \\\"My side is not coming forward with reasonable ways to defend an amendment that we think is very important. And so I'm looking at this going, 'Fine, if people are going to put forward solutions about certifying maybe who can buy an assault weapon, I'm certainly open to that.'\\\"Gun safety proposals are getting renewed attention in the wake of two back-to-back mass shootings in the US, including the Texas massacre, in which an 18-year-old killed 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde. And earlier this month, 10 people were killed in a racist mass shooting at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York.Kinzinger supports an assortment of such measures, including universal background checks,\\\"red flag\\\" laws and raising the age for those who want to buy high-capacity magazines. He said his position on the matter evolved after the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting, which left 58 people dead. \\\"At that point it's like, 'OK, this is getting out of hand,'\\\" Kinzinger told Bash. \\\"The problem is everyone is scared to inaction. They're frightened of the loudest voices. And 90% of Americans are begging that we do something.\\\" Meanwhile, Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas vocalized his opposition to certain gun overhaul proposals being floated, including background checks, red flag law, and changes to age restrictions, during a separate appearance on \\\"State of the Union.\\\" Instead, he advocated stronger security measures in schools.\\\"I think what needs to change is the things that would have the most immediate and succinct effect, and tangible effect on these things. And that's actual security at a school,\\\" he said.Pressed by Bash on whether greater school security and gun reform are mutually exclusive to him, Crenshaw said that gun control measures \\\"probably wouldn't have the outcome that you're looking for\\\" and would \\\"infringe on the rights of millions and millions of gun owners,\\\" whereas additional security would be \\\"fairly easy to afford.\\\"However, Crenshaw acknowledged earlier in the interview that law enforcement officials on the scene in Uvalde did not follow protocol and aid students. \\\"Now, I know better than most not to necessarily judge the person who's walking through the breach, and is in that moment, in the arena. But it does seem clear that protocols were not followed,\\\" he said.While the gunman was inside adjoining classrooms, a group of 19 law enforcement officers stood outside the classroom in the school for roughly 50 minutes as they waited for room keys and tactical equipment, CNN has reported. Meanwhile, children inside the classroom repeatedly called 911 and pleaded for help, Texas officials have said.

Gavin Newsom has tested positive for Covid-19 and is taking antiviral medication, his office announced Saturday. \\\"This morning, the governor tested positive for Covid-19 after exhibiting mild symptoms. The governor will continue to work remotely,\\\" the Democrat's office said in a statement, noting that he will be in isolation until at least June 2. \\\"The Governor has also received a prescription for Paxlovid, the antiviral that has been proven effective against COVID-19, and will begin his 5-day regimen immediately,\\\" the statement read. Newsom, 54, is fully vaccinated against Covid-19 and has received two booster shots, according to his office. Paxlovid, made by Pfizer, is a combination of two antiviral medications. It has been shown to be extremely effective at keeping mild cases of Covid from becoming more severe or even deadly. The US Food and Drug Administration authorized it for emergency use in December, after a clinical trial found that a five-day course cut the risk of being hospitalized or dying by 88% in unvaccinated people at high risk of severe outcomes from a Covid-19 infection.Last September, two of Newsom's four children tested positive for Covid-19, but both the governor, his wife and their two other children tested negative for the virus at the time. The governor is among a slew of high-profile politicians who have tested positive for the virus this year, including Vice President Kamala Harris, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice.Last year, Newsom beat back an effort to recall him from office before the end of his term that had grown out of frustration over his response to the pandemic and the state's strict Covid-19 measures.

The Biden administration has previously canceled more than $18.5 billion of student debt through existing forgiveness programs, in addition to issuing several extensions of the pandemic-era moratorium on student loan payments.\\n \\n\\n About half of Americans, 49%, think the US government is doing too little to address student loan debt, according to a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS in late April and May, with 24% saying that the government is doing too much, and the remainder that the current approach is about right. For comparison, 81% say the government is taking too little action on inflation.\\n \\n\\n A majority of Democrats (56%) \\u2013 and an even wider majority of self-described liberals (69%) \\u2013 say the government is doing too little on student loan debt, according to the CNN poll, while only a third of Republicans and self-described conservatives alike say the same. Seventy percent of adults younger than 35 say the government is doing too little, a figure that drops to 50% among those in the 35-49 age bracket, and 35% among those age 50 or older. \\n \\n\\n There are also racial and income-based divides: Six in 10 of people of color say the government is doing too little, compared with 42% of White Americans who say the same. And 57% of those in households making less than $50,000 annually want to see more government action, compared with 42% in higher-earning households.\\n \\n\\n By contrast, however, there's little divide between college graduates and those without a degree: 50% of Americans without a college degree say the government should take more action on student loan debt, as do 47% of college graduates. \\n \\n\\n While younger adults are generally supportive of government action on student debt, their views also diverge along political and demographic lines. In a March poll of Americans ages 18-29, conducted by the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School, 38% of young adults said that the government should cancel student loan debt for everyone, 21% that debt should be canceled 'only for those most in need,' 27% that the government should not cancel debts but instead help with repayment options, and 13% that there should be no change in government policy on the issue. \\n \\n\\n Roughly half of young Democrats (48%) said the government should cancel all student loan debt, with 77% saying the government should cancel debt for at least some Americans; among young Republicans, 20% favored canceling all student loan debt, and 35% thought at least some debts should be canceled. \\n \\n\\n Half of young Black Americans supported fully canceling student loan debts, compared with 43% of Hispanic young adults, 38% of young Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and 33% of White young adults. There was again relatively little difference between current college students (41% of whom said all student loan debt should be canceled), college graduates (39% of whom said that) and those who neither held a degree nor were currently enrolled (36%). \\n \\n\\n The Harvard poll also found that when asked about the national issue that concerned them the most, just 1% of young adults mentioned education costs or student debt \\u2013 19%, by contrast, mentioned inflation or the economy as a whole.\\n \\n\\n While surveys provide a fairly clear picture on how Americans divide over student loan policy, they're less consistent in the level of overall support they find for government action. There's a good reason for that \\u2013 the way pollsters present the issue also varies widely. Some surveys, for instance, ask about support or opposition for a specific plan, while others lay out a range of possible options.\\n \\n\\n In an Axios-Ipsos poll from August, for instance, 55% of Americans said they supported 'forgiving, or erasing, all federal student loan debt,' while 44% were opposed. But in a March 2021 poll from Grinnell College that asked Americans to pick between three policies, just 27% chose forgiving student loans for anyone with student debt, while 39% favored forgiving student loans 'only for those in need' and 29% said such loans shouldn't be forgiven at all. \\n \\n\\n Taken together, those numbers suggest that, with the scale and scope of government action on student loan debt still unknown, public opinion toward a hypothetical response remains equally inchoate. There's a well of potential support for some sort of action on student debt, but less consensus around precisely what form that should take \\u2013 and significant room for Americans to change their mind, depending both on the details of any policy, and the politics of its rollout.\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":61,\"topic\":\"politics\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":\"Ariel Edwards-Levy\",\"media\":\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220527183336-college-graduates-cap-file-051422.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":\"@cnnpolitics\",\"_score\":1.998283,\"_id\":\"42e8bcbed0bfefeb96cb480cf0ca952b\"},{\"title\":\"Ukraine war sparks fears China may follow Russia's playbook\",\"author\":null,\"published_date\":\"2022-05-27 10:41:57\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2022/05/27/china-taiwan-russia-playbook-watson-pkg-intl-hnk-nr-vpx.cnn\",\"clean_url\":\"cnn.com\",\"excerpt\":\"There have been increasing fears that Beijing will take military action against Taiwan following Russia's invasion of Ukraine as Chinese leader Xi Jinping has made retaking control of Taiwan a top\\u2026\",\"summary\":\"\",\"rights\":\"cnn.com\",\"rank\":61,\"topic\":\"politics\",\"country\":\"US\",\"language\":\"en\",\"authors\":null,\"media\":\"https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220204040512-xi-jinping-putin-pre-olympics-02042022-unlimited-super-tease.jpg\",\"is_opinion\":false,\"twitter_account\":null,\"_score\":1.998283,\"_id\":\"a1f12482c17175f53bfbce460e54f5e9\"},{\"title\":\"Oklahoma GOP governor signs anti-transgender bathroom bill into law\",\"author\":\"Andy Rose and Paul LeBlanc, CNN\",\"published_date\":\"2022-05-26 02:22:16\",\"published_date_precision\":\"full\",\"link\":\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/25/politics/oklahoma-anti-transgender-bathroom-law-signed-stitt/index.html\",\"clean_url\":\"cnn.com\",\"excerpt\":\"Oklahoma Gov.
