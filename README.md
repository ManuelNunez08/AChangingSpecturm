This project is part of my senior thesis which aims to build different NLP models that are able to classify news articles within the political spectrum. Please find a PDF version of the thesis as part of the repository. 
All news articles used to conduct the project are sourced from the NewsCatcher API which provides an easy-to-use and flexible interface for querying news feed (Link to their site:Â https://www.newscatcherapi.com/).

This thesis examines the categorization of political sentiment within US news media, contrasting the performance of rule-based and deep learning Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. A rule- based sentiment analysis model was developed to 
quantify the polarity and intensity of political bias, targeting sentiment towards nouns by analyzing associated adjectives and verbs. This model, grounded in coreference resolution and "closest POS" algorithms, creates a vectorized sentiment 
representation for each political orientation. Conversely, a deep learning approach utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was implemented to assess raw text through various neural layers that employ dimensional reduction without any 
prior sentiment extraction. The thesis advocates for a hybrid model, leveraging the strengths of both techniques for multidimensional data analysis. The research culminates in an application of these models, tracking sentiment progression in 
major news outlets over the 21st century. Finally, the work explores the practical utility of both models by graphing the sentiment biases of CNN and FOX News. This empirical examination further distinguishes between the correctness of each model. 
By analyzing vast quantities of news content and offering a nuanced understanding of political sentiment, this thesis provides significant insights into the composition of political bias in news media and contributes to the ongoing discourse on 
computational methods in media analysis.
